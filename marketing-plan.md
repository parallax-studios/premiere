# PREMIERE — Marketing Plan

**Project:** PREMIERE
**Marketing Lead:** HYPE
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

## 0. HYPE's Take

Let me be real with you. I've seen brilliant games die because marketing started the week before launch. I've watched incredible work get buried under algorithm noise because nobody thought about wishlists, hooks, or GIFs until it was too late. That will NOT happen here.

PREMIERE has everything you need for a breakout indie hit. The hook is instant. The audience is hungry. The market is wide open. No other management sim has tackled the television industry with this depth. No other strategy game has made the scheduling grid THE mechanic. This is Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men on a magnetic whiteboard, and people don't even know they've been waiting for it.

But none of that matters if we don't start building the audience NOW.

Marketing is not a phase. It's a practice that runs from the first prototype to the last sale. This document is your roadmap from "what even is this game?" to "I have 50,000 wishlists and press wants to cover launch day."

The rule is simple: Show the GAME, not the features. Show The Board. Show the hand dragging a card. Show the ratings coming in. Show the agonizing Thursday 9 PM decision. Make people feel the corner office before they click buy.

Let's build the audience.

---

## 1. The Hook (Three Versions)

Every piece of marketing starts with the hook. The hook is not the feature list. The hook is the 5-second scroll-stop moment. The hook is the one sentence that makes someone go "oh, that's cool."

### 1.1 One Sentence (The Scroll-Stop)

**"Run a TV network in the 2000s golden age — schedule shows, crush the ratings, decide: Emmys or eyeballs?"**

This is the tweet. This is the Steam capsule text. This is the elevator pitch. 15 words. Two commas. One choice that defines the entire game.

### 1.2 One Paragraph (The Store Page Hook)

**You're the executive with the corner office and the scheduling board. It's 2003. The Sopranos just proved TV can be art. American Idol just proved TV can print money. You greenlight pilots, drag show cards onto a weekly grid, read overnight Nielsen ratings, manage diva talent, survive sweeps week, and answer the question that defined an era: do you chase prestige or popularity? Every Thursday at 9 PM is a war. Every cancellation is a wound. Every season is a bet. What does America watch this fall?**

This is the first paragraph on the Steam page. It's 95 words of setup, fantasy, and tension. It tells you what you DO (greenlight, schedule, manage) and what you FEEL (war, wound, bet).

### 1.3 One Page (The Press Pitch)

**PREMIERE is a management sim where you run a cable network during the 2000s golden age of television (2000-2012). You are the network executive. The scheduling board is your strategy layer. Every decision ripples.**

**THE CORE LOOP:**
You greenlight pilots from a procedurally-generated pool (the AI creates infinite television shows with genres, premises, casts, and showrunners). You drag show cards onto a 7-day x 3-timeslot weekly grid. Lead-in effects, demographic targeting, and competitive counterprogramming determine performance. Overnight ratings arrive every week. You respond: renew, cancel, reschedule, pour marketing dollars into sweeps. Rinse, repeat, survive.

**THE TENSION:**
Every show you schedule is a bet. The prestige drama that critics love pulls 5 million viewers. The cheap procedural you're embarrassed by pulls 12 million. The advertisers want the 12 million. The showrunners want respect. The audience wants everything and nothing. You sit between all of them with 22 timeslots and 40 pilots. What do you build?

**THE TWIST:**
The era shifts beneath you. DVRs erode live ratings. Reality TV explodes. The writers' strike guts your pipeline. Cable networks poach your talent. Netflix starts streaming. You can't stop the cliff. You can only decide what you built before the fall.

**THE PITCH:**
Game Dev Tycoon proved players love managing creative industries. Football Manager proved players will obsess over systems when the fiction is compelling. PREMIERE sits at the intersection: a tycoon game where the product is culture, the interface is iconic, and the AI generates infinite television for you to manage. The 2000s TV nostalgia wave is cresting. The management sim audience is hungry. No one has done this.

**TARGET:**
Adults 25-45 who binged Succession, read Bill Carter's "The War for Late Night," and have opinions about NBC's Thursday lineup. PC (Steam) primary, Steam Deck secondary. Demo at PAX, market on Twitter/X to TV obsessives, convert r/tycoon into evangelists.

**THE GIF:**
A hand dragging a show card onto a glowing scheduling grid. The adjacent numbers ripple. Overnight ratings slide in. That's the game. That's the scroll-stop. That's PREMIERE.

## 2. Target Audience Profile

### 2.1 Primary Audience (The Core)

**Who they are:**
- **Age:** 25-45 (skewing 30-40, the generation that grew up during the 2000s TV golden age)
- **Gender:** 60% male, 40% female (management sim audience leans male, but TV enthusiasm crosses gender)
- **Occupation:** White-collar professionals, knowledge workers, creatives, media industry adjacent
- **Income:** $50K-$120K (can afford $25 game without hesitation)

**What they play:**
- Game Dev Tycoon, Software Inc., Two Point Hospital (management/tycoon games)
- Football Manager, Motorsport Manager (deep simulation with real-world flavor)
- Slay the Spire, Cultist Simulator (card-based strategy, meaningful placement decisions)
- Crusader Kings III, Civilization VI (long-term planning, emergent storytelling)

**What they watch:**
- Succession, The Morning Show, Mad Men (workplace dramas about power and creative industries)
- The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad (the prestige shows that defined the era PREMIERE is set in)
- 30 Rock, Silicon Valley (behind-the-scenes workplace comedies with industry authenticity)
- Documentaries about TV history: "The Center Will Not Hold" (Joan Didion), "Hemingway" (Ken Burns), any Errol Morris

**What they read:**
- "The War for Late Night" by Bill Carter (the Leno-Conan conflict)
- "Difficult Men" by Brett Martin (the golden age showrunners)
- "Top of the Rock" by Warren Littlefield (NBC's 1990s dominance)
- r/television, r/tycoon, Film Twitter, TV criticism blogs (The AV Club, Vulture, Variety)

**Where they hang out online:**
- Reddit: r/tycoon, r/gamedev, r/television, r/askreddit threads about TV
- Twitter/X: Media criticism circles, TV writers' rooms, game dev communities
- Discord: Management sim servers, indie game communities
- YouTube: Game design analysis channels (GMTK, Adam Millard), TV retrospectives (Defunctland, Quinton Reviews)

**What they want from this game:**
- The fantasy of control in a chaotic industry
- The satisfaction of mastering a complex system
- The nostalgia of the 2000s without irony or parody
- The "one more turn" compulsion of watching their schedule succeed or fail
- Stories they tell their friends: "You won't BELIEVE what happened in my Season 4"

**Why they'll buy:**
- It's the intersection of two things they love: management sims and television
- It tackles an industry no game has done well (Hollywood-adjacent games are mostly shallow)
- It respects their intelligence (no hand-holding, systems-driven, emergent stories)
- It's on Steam, it's $25, and it looks like 40 hours of depth

### 2.2 Secondary Audience (The Expanders)

**Who they are:**
- **Age:** 18-35, younger management sim enthusiasts
- **Characteristics:** Played Stardew Valley, Factorio, RimWorld — love systems and optimization
- **Why they'll come:** The core loop (card placement, lead-in math, demographic targeting) is strategically rich even if they don't care about 2000s TV nostalgia
- **How to reach them:** Reddit r/tycoon recommendations, Steam Discovery Queue, "Players who liked Game Dev Tycoon also liked..."

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience (The Sleepers)

**Who they are:**
- **Age:** 30-55, casual strategy players who loved PopCap-era puzzle games but want more depth now
- **Characteristics:** They played Diner Dash, Cake Mania, time management games on PC in the 2000s; now they want something with more meat but the same "just one more round" energy
- **Why they'll come:** Accessibility of the core interaction (dragging cards is intuitive), combined with strategic depth they didn't know they wanted
- **How to reach them:** Nintendo Switch port (post-launch), word-of-mouth from spouses/friends in primary audience, Apple Arcade-style casual curation (if we go that route for visibility)

### 2.4 Anti-Audience (Who This Is NOT For)

Be clear about who we're NOT targeting, so we don't waste energy:

- **Action gamers:** If your favorite games are Call of Duty and Fortnite, PREMIERE will feel slow. We don't chase this audience.
- **Pure story-driven players:** If you need cutscenes and voiced characters, this isn't that game. The story emerges from systems, not scripts.
- **Mobile-first audiences:** PREMIERE is dense and requires sustained attention. It's not a commute game.
- **Players allergic to numbers:** If you hate spreadsheets, Football Manager, or any game that shows you stats, this will feel like homework.

Don't try to make the game appeal to everyone. Appeal HARD to the core, and let the secondary audiences discover it naturally.

## 3. Marketing Timeline and Beats

Marketing follows the development timeline. Each phase has specific goals, deliverables, and success metrics.

### 3.1 Timeline Overview

| Phase | Timeframe | Goal | Key Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PROTOTYPE** | Months 1-3 | Validate the hook | The Board GIF |
| **PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT** | Months 4-6 | Build anticipation | Steam page live, Twitter presence |
| **FIRST REVEAL** | Month 7 | Announce the game | Trailer, press outreach, wishlist push |
| **ALPHA/DEMO** | Months 8-12 | Let people play | Steam Next Fest demo, influencer keys |
| **BETA** | Months 13-15 | Refine and amplify | Closed beta, content creator coverage |
| **LAUNCH PREP** | Month 16 | Final push | Launch trailer, press embargo lifts |
| **LAUNCH** | Month 17 | Release | Day-one execution, review codes, community management |
| **POST-LAUNCH** | Months 18-24 | Sustain momentum | Updates, DLC teases, ports |

### 3.2 Phase 1: PROTOTYPE (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Validate that the core loop is marketable. Does The Board GIF make people stop scrolling?

**Deliverables:**
1. **The Board GIF (Week 6):**
   - 10-second looping GIF: Hand dragging a show card from one slot to another, adjacent numbers rippling, ratings reveal sliding in
   - Polish the UI before recording this — The Board is the visual identity of the entire game
   - Export at 1920x1080, compress to <5MB, optimize for Twitter auto-play
   - Test on 20 people who've never seen the game. Ask: "What do you think this is?" If 15+ say something like "scheduling TV shows" or "managing a network," the GIF works.

2. **Proof-of-Concept Playable:**
   - Not for public release, but for internal validation
   - One full week cycle: schedule 5 shows, simulate, see ratings, respond
   - Confirm the loop is satisfying before building 12 seasons around it

3. **Core Messaging Document (Internal):**
   - Finalize the hook (Section 1)
   - Finalize the audience (Section 2)
   - This document serves as the bible for all external communication

**Success Metrics:**
- The Board GIF gets 80%+ positive reaction in internal testing
- You can explain the game in one sentence and people immediately "get it"

### 3.3 Phase 2: PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Build a small, engaged audience BEFORE the big reveal. Start the conversation before you're ready to sell.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Steam Page Goes Live (Month 4, Week 1):**
   - Title, capsule art, short description, screenshots (even if early/placeholder)
   - "Coming Soon" — no release date yet
   - Wishlist button active immediately
   - **Why early?** Steam's algorithm favors games that accumulate wishlists over time. A page that goes live 12 months before launch and steadily builds 20K wishlists performs better than a page that goes live 2 months out and scrambles to 10K.

2. **Twitter/X Account Launch (Month 4, Week 1):**
   - Handle: @PremiereGame or @PlayPremiere (check availability)
   - Bio: "Run a TV network. Schedule the hits. Cancel the flops. Chase Emmys or eyeballs? Management sim set in the 2000s golden age. Wishlist on Steam: [link]"
   - Header image: The Board (clean, wide shot of the scheduling grid)
   - Profile pic: PREMIERE logo icon
   - **First 10 tweets:**
     - The Board GIF with caption: "Thursday at 9 PM. Your prestige drama vs. their procedural juggernaut. What do you do?"
     - Behind-the-scenes screenshot: "Designing the pilot pipeline. The AI generates 40 new shows every season. No two playthroughs are the same."
     - Quote from REED: "What's the loop? The loop is The Board."
     - Comp tweet: "If Game Dev Tycoon met Mad Men on a scheduling grid."
     - Audience question: "What's your favorite 2000s TV drama? (We're doing research.)"
     - The Hook: One-sentence pitch
     - Early screenshot: Overnight ratings screen
     - Development poll: "Which should hurt more: cancelling a hit show early or letting a declining show run two seasons too long?"
     - Steam wishlist link with GIF
     - Follow-up: "We're building this in public. Follow for dev updates, design breakdowns, and the occasional Sopranos reference."

3. **Reddit Presence (Month 5):**
   - Post The Board GIF to r/tycoon with title: "I'm building a management sim where you run a TV network in the 2000s. You schedule shows on a grid, read Nielsen ratings, and decide: Emmys or eyeballs?"
   - Post to r/gamedev (once) as a "Show & Tell Saturday" post
   - DO NOT spam. One post per subreddit, engage authentically in comments.
   - Goal: 200-500 upvotes on r/tycoon is realistic for a good hook. That's 5K-10K eyeballs.

4. **Devlog Series (Months 5-6):**
   - Publish bi-weekly devlogs on Twitter, Steam community page, and personal blog (if applicable)
   - Topics:
     - "How the AI generates television shows"
     - "The math behind lead-in effects"
     - "Why the 2000s? (And why the era ends in 2012)"
     - "Designing The Board: Making a scheduling grid feel like strategy, not busywork"
   - Each devlog ends with: "Wishlist on Steam: [link]"

**Success Metrics:**
- 1,000 Steam wishlists by end of Month 6 (realistic for pre-announcement phase with no trailer)
- 500 Twitter followers
- 80%+ positive sentiment in Reddit comments

### 3.4 Phase 3: FIRST REVEAL (Month 7)

**Goal:** Announce the game to the world. This is the big push. Press coverage, trailer, wishlist conversion.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Announcement Trailer (60 seconds):**
   - **Structure:**
     - 0:00-0:05: Black screen. Audio: phone ringing, fluorescent hum. Text: "2003."
     - 0:05-0:10: Cut to The Board (empty grid). A hand places the first show card.
     - 0:10-0:20: Montage of card placements, ratings reveals, Variety headlines ("HIT DRAMA CRUSHES COMPETITION," "REALITY TV DOMINATES SWEEPS"), Emmy icons, talent negotiation pop-ups, budget ledgers.
     - 0:20-0:30: Voiceover (optional, or just text on screen): "You greenlight the shows. You schedule the week. You read the ratings. You decide who gets a second season. And who gets cancelled."
     - 0:30-0:40: Quick cuts: A show card being dragged to Thursday 9 PM. Overnight ratings: 8.4M viewers. A competitor's show: 12.1M viewers. A phone rings. A cancellation decision prompt: "End it now or give it one more season?"
     - 0:40-0:50: Text on screen: "The golden age of television. The corner office. The schedule. The choice."
     - 0:50-0:55: Logo reveal: "PREMIERE"
     - 0:55-0:60: Text: "Wishlist now on Steam" + URL
   - **Tone:** Sincere, not satirical. Music: Slow-building tension (strings, minimal piano) that swells at the logo reveal. Reference: "Moneyball" trailer, "The Social Network" teaser.
   - **Deliverables:**
     - 60-second version for YouTube/Twitter
     - 30-second cut for paid ads (if budget allows)
     - 15-second teaser for Twitter pre-announcement: just The Board GIF with text: "Coming soon."

2. **Press Outreach (Month 7, Week 1):**
   - **Target outlets (Tier 1 — send personalized pitches):**
     - PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN PC, Polygon, Eurogamer, Kotaku
     - Niche: Strategy Gamer, Wargamer (they cover deep sims)
     - YouTube: Wanderbots, SplatterCatGaming, Retromation, Pravus Gaming (strategy/sim YouTubers)
   - **Target outlets (Tier 2 — send press release):**
     - Game Informer, GamesRadar, Destructoid, GameSpot
     - TV/entertainment press: Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, AV Club, Vulture (PREMIERE is a game ABOUT television — entertainment press might bite)
   - **Pitch email template:**
     ```
     Subject: PREMIERE — Manage a TV network in the 2000s golden age (new PC management sim)

     Hi [Name],

     I'm reaching out because PREMIERE feels like it's in your coverage wheelhouse: a PC management sim where you run a cable network during the 2000s golden age of television.

     The hook: You greenlight pilots, schedule shows on a drag-and-drop grid, read Nielsen overnight ratings, manage diva showrunners, and answer the only question that matters: do you chase Emmys or eyeballs?

     What makes it different:
     - The scheduling grid is the core mechanic (no other management sim has made "what airs when" the primary strategic verb)
     - The AI procedurally generates infinite TV shows with premises, casts, genres, and showrunners
     - The era spans 2000-2012 — you live through DVRs, reality TV, the writers' strike, and the streaming cliff
     - It's Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men meets Football Manager

     Announcement trailer: [YouTube link]
     Steam page: [link]
     Press kit: [link to kit with screenshots, fact sheet, logo, trailer download]

     Would you be interested in coverage? I can provide early access keys as development progresses.

     Thanks for your time,
     [Your name]
     [Studio name]
     ```

3. **Press Kit:**
   - **Contents:**
     - Fact sheet (1 page): Game title, genre, platforms, release window, price, hook, key features, studio info, contact
     - Trailer (downloadable MP4, 1080p)
     - Screenshots (10-15 high-res PNGs): The Board, pilot evaluation screen, overnight ratings, talent negotiation, Emmy ceremony, legacy score
     - Logo pack (PNG, transparent background, multiple sizes)
     - Developer quote: "PREMIERE is our love letter to the golden age of television and the impossible people who had to decide what America watched." — [Your name], Creative Director
   - **Host:** Dropbox or Google Drive link. Simple, organized folders. No password unless press requests it.

4. **Social Media Blitz (Month 7, Week 1):**
   - Twitter: Announcement tweet with trailer link. Pin it.
   - Reddit: Post trailer to r/tycoon, r/Games (read their rules — you may need to participate in a "Trailer Tuesday" thread), r/pcgaming
   - Steam: Announcement post on community hub
   - Discord: If you have a server or are in relevant indie dev/management sim servers, share (but don't spam)

**Success Metrics:**
- 5,000 wishlists in the first week (aggressive but achievable with good press pickup)
- 3+ press articles (even if just "here's a new game announced today" listicles)
- 50K+ trailer views across YouTube/Twitter/Reddit
- Sustained wishlist growth: 100+ per day for the 30 days following announcement

### 3.5 Phase 4: ALPHA/DEMO (Months 8-12)

**Goal:** Let people PLAY the game. A vertical slice demo is worth 100 trailers.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Steam Next Fest Demo (Target: Month 10):**
   - **What it is:** Steam Next Fest runs 3-4 times per year (February, June, October). It's a week-long festival where upcoming games release free demos. It's the single best wishlist-generation event for indie games.
   - **PREMIERE's demo scope:**
     - One full season: Fall 2000 (September through November Sweeps)
     - 5 pre-set shows in your starting lineup, 15 pilots to evaluate
     - Simplified grid: 5 nights x 2 timeslots (10 slots total) to reduce overwhelm
     - Full tutorial integrated into first 3 weeks
     - Ends with a "Thanks for playing" screen that shows your network's performance and a Steam wishlist button
   - **Why this scope?**
     - Completable in 60-90 minutes (Next Fest players are sampling dozens of demos — respect their time)
     - Long enough to feel the core loop: schedule → simulate → ratings → respond → reschedule
     - Short enough that they WANT more when it ends
   - **Demo-exclusive hook:**
     - At the end, show a teaser: "The full game spans 2000-2012. Twelve seasons. DVR disruption. The writers' strike. The rise of streaming. Your demo just showed you Fall 2000. The cliff is coming. Will you be ready?"

2. **Influencer Outreach (Month 9-12):**
   - **Target creators:**
     - **Tier 1 (50K+ subscribers, focus on 2-3 max):**
       - Wanderbots (strategy/simulation specialist, 180K subs)
       - SplatterCatGaming (indie showcase king, 500K subs)
       - Pravus Gaming (grand strategy, deep sims, 200K subs)
     - **Tier 2 (10K-50K subscribers, broader outreach):**
       - Retromation, Aliensrock, DasTactic, quill18, EnterElysium (all cover management sims)
     - **Tier 3 (1K-10K, enthusiast creators):**
       - Find them on YouTube searching "Game Dev Tycoon gameplay" or "management sim 2024" — these creators have small but engaged audiences
   - **Outreach email:**
     ```
     Subject: Early access key for PREMIERE (TV network management sim)

     Hi [Name],

     I'm reaching out because you've covered [Game Dev Tycoon / Software Inc. / etc.] and I think PREMIERE might be up your alley.

     The pitch: You run a cable TV network in the 2000s. Greenlight pilots, schedule shows on a grid, read Nielsen ratings, manage talent, chase Emmys or profits. It's Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men.

     I'd love to send you an early access key (the game is in alpha, so expect some rough edges, but the core loop is solid). No obligations, no strings — if it's not your thing, no worries. But if you dig it and want to cover it, that would be amazing.

     Trailer: [link]
     Steam page: [link]

     Let me know if you're interested.

     Thanks,
     [Your name]
     ```
   - **Timing:** Send keys 2-4 weeks before Steam Next Fest so videos go live during or just after the fest (capitalizing on demo buzz)

3. **Community Building (Month 10 onward):**
   - **Discord server launch (optional but recommended):**
     - Channels: #announcements, #general, #strategy-discussion, #feedback, #bug-reports, #off-topic
     - Invite link pinned on Twitter, Steam page, and in-game demo end screen
     - Goal: 200-500 members by launch. This is your beta testing pool and your day-one evangelists.
   - **Weekly dev updates on Steam:**
     - Every Friday, post a short update: what you worked on this week, a screenshot, a question for the community ("Should we add a 'fire the showrunner' option or is that too brutal?")
     - Engage in comments. The studio that responds to every comment builds loyalty.

**Success Metrics:**
- 10,000 demo downloads during Next Fest week
- 30% conversion rate (demo players who wishlist the game) = +3,000 wishlists
- 3+ YouTuber videos with 10K+ views each
- Discord server hits 250 members

### 3.6 Phase 5: BETA (Months 13-15)

**Goal:** Refine the game based on feedback. Build hype through closed beta access.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Closed Beta (Month 13):**
   - Invite 100-200 players from Discord, Twitter followers, and Next Fest demo high-engagement players
   - Beta runs for 4-6 weeks
   - Beta build = full game, rough UI, some balance issues
   - Players sign NDA (optional) or just ask them politely not to stream (most will respect it)
   - Collect feedback via Google Form or Discord channels

2. **Beta Feedback Loop:**
   - Weekly surveys: "What's the most frustrating part of the game?"
   - Balance tuning based on data: If 80% of players never schedule reality shows, reality is undertuned.
   - Bug reports prioritized by severity

3. **Content Creator Beta Keys (Month 14):**
   - Send keys to Tier 1 and Tier 2 influencers with embargo lift date (e.g., "Feel free to cover this starting March 1st")
   - Goal: 5-10 videos go live in the month before launch

**Success Metrics:**
- 500+ hours of beta playtime logged across all testers
- 80%+ positive sentiment in feedback ("I would recommend this game")
- 5+ influencer videos scheduled for pre-launch window

### 3.7 Phase 6: LAUNCH PREP (Month 16)

**Goal:** Final marketing push. Maximize day-one visibility.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Launch Trailer (90 seconds):**
   - Longer than the announcement trailer. More gameplay footage. More tone.
   - Structure:
     - 0:00-0:10: Cold open. Voiceover or text: "It's 2000. The Sopranos just changed everything. American Idol is about to change everything else. You're the executive. What does America watch?"
     - 0:10-0:40: Gameplay montage showing a full season arc: Fall premiere → ratings struggles → midseason cancellation → sweeps push → season finale. Show the EMOTION (a showrunner calling, a cancellation decision, an Emmy win, a budget crisis).
     - 0:40-0:60: Feature highlights (fast cuts): AI-generated shows, talent relationships, competitive networks, era shifts, the writers' strike
     - 0:60-0:75: Pull quote if you have press reviews: "The best management sim of 2027" or "Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men — and it works"
     - 0:75-0:85: Release date reveal. Price. Platforms.
     - 0:85-0:90: Logo. "Available now on Steam."

2. **Press Review Embargoes (Month 16, Week 2):**
   - Send final review builds to press 3-4 weeks before launch
   - Set embargo date: Launch day at 10 AM PT (standard practice)
   - Target outlets: Same as announcement outreach + any outlets that expressed interest

3. **Steam Store Page Update:**
   - Update with final trailer, final screenshots, accurate feature list
   - Add "Launch Discount" (10-15% off for the first week — this incentivizes day-one purchases and boosts algorithm visibility)

4. **Social Media Final Push:**
   - Tweet every day in the final week: GIFs, screenshots, dev quotes, countdown ("3 days until launch")
   - Reddit: Post launch announcement to r/tycoon, r/pcgaming, r/Games (follow their rules for self-promotion)

**Success Metrics:**
- 20,000 wishlists by launch day (from 1K at announcement to 20K over 16 months = healthy growth curve)
- 5+ press reviews scheduled for launch day
- 100K+ launch trailer views

### 3.8 Phase 7: LAUNCH (Month 17)

**Goal:** Execute launch day flawlessly. Maximize sales and visibility in the critical first week.

**Launch Day Checklist:**
- Game goes live on Steam at 10 AM PT (standard time for global launches — hits US morning, EU afternoon)
- Launch discount active (10-15% off)
- Launch trailer pinned on Steam page, Twitter, YouTube
- Press embargo lifts — reviews go live
- Respond to every review (good or bad) on Steam within 24 hours
- Monitor Discord and social media for bug reports
- Post "We're live!" announcement on Twitter, Reddit, Discord

**First Week:**
- Daily Twitter posts with player stories, screenshots, tips
- Track Steam reviews — aim for "Very Positive" (80%+ positive)
- Patch Day 2 or 3 if critical bugs emerge (shows you're responsive)

**Success Metrics:**
- 2,000 units sold in the first week (realistic for indie management sim with solid marketing)
- "Very Positive" Steam review score
- 5+ press reviews with 7+/10 scores
- Break even on marketing spend within 30 days

### 3.9 Phase 8: POST-LAUNCH (Months 18-24)

**Goal:** Sustain momentum. Convert launch buyers into evangelists. Plan long-term content.

**Tactics:**

## 4. Store Page Copy

The Steam store page is your 24/7 salesperson. Every word earns its place.

### 4.1 Short Description (300 characters max)

**"Run a cable network in the 2000s golden age. Greenlight shows, schedule the week, read the ratings, crush the competition. Do you chase Emmys or eyeballs? Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men on a scheduling grid."**

(298 characters. This appears under the game title in Steam search and is the elevator pitch.)

### 4.2 About This Game (Long Description)

**You are the network executive.**

It's 2000. The Sopranos just proved television can be art. Survivor just proved it can print money. You sit in the corner office with a scheduling board, a stack of pilot scripts, and a phone that won't stop ringing. Your job is simple: decide what America watches.

Greenlight pilots. Schedule your weekly lineup. Read the Nielsen overnight ratings. Manage diva talent. Survive sweeps. Build a legacy.

The question that defined an era: do you chase prestige or popularity?

---

**THE BOARD**

Your primary interface is a 7-day x 3-timeslot scheduling grid. Drag show cards onto the board. Every placement is strategic. Lead-in effects, demographic targeting, and competitive counterprogramming determine performance. Thursday at 9 PM against a rival's flagship? That's a war. Friday at 10 PM against a movie night? That's a death sentence. The Board is the game.

---

**THE SHOWS**

Every season, the AI generates 30-40 original pilots: premises, genres, casts, showrunners, budgets. No two playthroughs are the same. Greenlight a prestige drama from an auteur who misses deadlines. Greenlight a cheap procedural that rates like clockwork. Greenlight a reality show you're embarrassed by but can't afford to cancel. Your development budget is finite. Choose carefully.

Shows evolve over seasons. Quality rises or declines. Casts leave. Audiences grow or erode. A show that starts with 4 million viewers might become a cultural phenomenon. Or it might bleed out over 22 agonizing weeks.

---

**THE RATINGS**

Every week, overnight Nielsen ratings arrive. Total viewers. 18-49 demo. Share percentage. How you did against the competition. The numbers are cold, precise, and final. Advertisers pay for eyeballs. The parent company demands quarterly growth. The showrunners want creative freedom. You sit between all of them with a spreadsheet and a conscience.

---

**THE TALENT**

Showrunners, actors, writers, directors. Persistent AI-driven personalities with egos, grudges, and career arcs. A showrunner whose last show you cancelled will not bring you their best work. A star whose contract is up will demand triple their salary or walk. The head writer threatens to quit if you move the show to Fridays. Television is made by humans. Humans are complicated.

---

**THE ERA**

The game spans 2000-2012. The golden age. The cliff.

- 2000-2003: Post-Sopranos prestige rush. Reality TV explodes. You build your empire.
- 2004-2007: DVRs fragment the audience. Cable networks poach talent. The old rules bend.
- 2007-2008: The writers' strike. No scripts. No development. Reality fills the void.
- 2009-2012: Netflix starts streaming. "Cord-cutting" enters the vocabulary. The ground shifts.

You can't stop the era from ending. You can only decide what you built before the fall.

---

**KEY FEATURES**

- **The Scheduling Grid** — Drag-and-drop strategy. Adjacency matters. Lead-in effects, demographic flow, competitive counterprogramming.
- **AI Show Generation** — 30-40 new pilots every season. Procedural premises, genres, casts, budgets. Infinite television.
- **Ratings Engine** — Three rival networks with AI-driven strategies. Audience simulation models DVR adoption, sweeps spikes, genre saturation.
- **Talent Management** — Persistent showrunners, actors, and executives with relationships, egos, and memories.
- **Era Progression** — 2000-2012. Industry shifts: reality boom, DVR disruption, writers' strike, streaming.
- **The Reckoning** — The game ends with a legacy score. The shows you greenlit. The shows you cancelled. The schedule you built. Judge yourself.

## 5. Social Media Content Plan

Social media is not about broadcasting. It's about conversation. Every post should invite engagement.

### 5.1 Twitter/X Strategy

**Posting Frequency:**
- **Pre-announcement:** 2-3 times per week
- **Announcement week:** Daily
- **Alpha/Demo phase:** 3-4 times per week
- **Launch month:** Daily
- **Post-launch:** 3-4 times per week

**Content Pillars (rotate through these):**

1. **The Hook (10% of posts):**
   - Restate the pitch in different ways
   - "Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men."
   - "Run a TV network. Schedule shows. Read ratings. Chase Emmys or eyeballs?"
   - "Thursday at 9 PM. Your prestige drama vs. their procedural. What's the play?"

2. **GIFs and Gameplay (40% of posts):**
   - The Board GIF (post it every 2-3 weeks — it's your visual identity)
   - Screen recordings of key moments: ratings reveal, cancellation decision, talent negotiation
   - Short clips (10-15 seconds, native Twitter video uploads perform better than YouTube links)

3. **Behind-the-Scenes / Dev Insights (20% of posts):**
   - "We just implemented the writers' strike event. Testing it broke my heart."
   - "Fun fact: The AI generates show titles by combining genre tropes with random cultural references. Today it pitched 'The Last Attorney' and I want to watch that."
   - Show the work. People love seeing how games are made.

4. **Audience Engagement (20% of posts):**
   - Questions: "What's your favorite 2000s TV show?" "Would you cancel a critically acclaimed show that's bombing in the ratings?"
   - Polls: "Which matters more: Emmys or eyeballs?" (Spoiler: this will split 50/50, and the discourse in replies is marketing gold)
   - Retweet fan reactions, YouTuber videos, Reddit threads

5. **Marketing Beats (10% of posts):**
   - Trailer drops
   - Steam Next Fest announcement
   - Launch date reveal
   - Discount announcements

**Tone:**
- Professional but not corporate
- Enthusiastic but not breathless
- Sincere, not ironic
- No emoji spam (one or two per tweet max)
- Write like a human, not a brand

**Example tweets:**

> Just implemented the talent negotiation system. A showrunner whose last show I cancelled for low ratings just pitched me a new show. I want to say yes because the pitch is incredible. I won't, because she hates me and it will go sideways. This game hurts in the right ways.

> Thursday at 9 PM. Your critically acclaimed drama pulls 5M viewers. The competitor's procedural pulls 14M. The showrunner calls. "Move us to a better slot or we walk." What's your play?

> We're at PAX West this weekend (Booth #4782). Come play PREMIERE. Schedule some shows. Ruin some lives. We have stickers.

> PREMIERE is now live on Steam. $22.49 (10% launch discount). Run a TV network in the 2000s. Chase Emmys. Chase ratings. Chase both and go broke trying. [link]

### 5.2 Reddit Strategy

**Subreddits to Engage:**
- r/tycoon (primary — this is your core audience)
- r/gamedev (for development posts, not pure marketing)
- r/IndieGaming (for milestone announcements)
- r/pcgaming (announcement and launch only)
- r/Games (follow their rules closely, announcements only)
- r/television (risky but worth trying — "I'm making a game about running a TV network" might resonate)

**Rules:**
- Each subreddit allows self-promotion differently. Read the rules. Follow them exactly.
- Post once per major milestone (announcement, demo, launch). Do not spam.
- Engage authentically in comments. If someone asks a question, answer it. If someone criticizes, engage respectfully.

**Example r/tycoon post:**

> **Title:** I'm building a tycoon game where you run a TV network in the 2000s. Schedule shows on a grid, read Nielsen ratings, decide if you chase Emmys or eyeballs.
>
> **Body:**
> Hey r/tycoon. I've been working on this for the past year and I think you'll dig it.
>
> **The pitch:** You're a network executive in the 2000s golden age of television (think Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men). You greenlight pilots, drag show cards onto a weekly scheduling grid, read overnight ratings, and manage diva showrunners. Do you build a prestige network or a ratings juggernaut? Both? Neither?
>
> **What makes it different:**
> - The scheduling grid is the core mechanic. Every placement decision is strategic (lead-in effects, competitive counterprogramming, demographic targeting).
> - The AI generates 30-40 new TV shows every season. No two playthroughs are the same.
> - The era spans 2000-2012. You live through DVRs, the writers' strike, and the rise of streaming. The game ends when the industry changes beneath you.
>
> **Where I'm at:**
> Alpha build. Playable but rough. Planning to do a Steam Next Fest demo in [Month].
>
> [GIF of The Board]
>
> Steam page: [link]
>
> Would love your feedback if you check it out. What other management sims should I study?

### 5.3 YouTube Strategy (If You Have Bandwidth)

**Dev Diary Series (Optional but High-Value):**
- 5-10 minute videos covering key design decisions
- Topics:
  - "Designing The Board: How I Made Scheduling Feel Like Strategy"
  - "How the AI Generates Television Shows"
  - "Why PREMIERE Ends in 2012 (And Why That Matters)"
- Upload to YouTube, embed on Steam page, share on Twitter/Reddit
- Goal: 500-2K views per video. This is not about going viral. It's about building trust with the core audience.

**Trailer Strategy:**
- Upload announcement trailer and launch trailer to your own channel (not just publisher/third-party channels)
- Optimize title/description for search: "PREMIERE - TV Network Management Sim - Announcement Trailer"
- Tags: management sim, tycoon game, indie game, strategy game, Game Dev Tycoon, TV industry

---

## 6. Press Outreach and Media Strategy

Press coverage is a force multiplier. One article on PC Gamer is worth 10,000 tweets.

### 6.1 Target Press Outlets (Prioritized)

- Game Developer (formerly Gamasutra — dev-focused but has audience reach)

**Tier 3 (General Gaming):**
- Kotaku
- GameSpot
- Destructoid
- GamesRadar

**Tier 4 (Entertainment Press — Long Shot but Worth Trying):**
- Variety (they cover games occasionally, and PREMIERE is ABOUT TV)
- The Hollywood Reporter (same logic)
- AV Club / Vulture (TV criticism + gaming sections)

**YouTube / Twitch:**
- Wanderbots, SplatterCatGaming, Pravus Gaming, Retromation, quill18, DasTactic, EnterElysium, Aliensrock
- Focus on strategy/sim specialists, not general gaming channels

### 6.2 Press Outreach Timeline

**Month 7 (Announcement):**

- Include trailer link, Steam page, press kit
- Goal: 3-5 articles ("New game announced" coverage)

**Month 10 (Demo Release / Steam Next Fest):**
- Send follow-up email to press: "The demo is live, playable now for one week"
- Many outlets cover Next Fest — they're looking for interesting demos to highlight
- Goal: 2-3 "Try this demo" articles

**Month 16 (Review Embargoes):**
- Send final review builds 3-4 weeks before launch

---

## 7. Community Building Strategy

A community is not an audience. An audience watches. A community participates.

### 7.1 Discord Server (Optional but Recommended)

**Why Discord?**
- Direct line to your most engaged players
- Real-time feedback during alpha/beta
- Builds loyalty (players who join Discord are 3x more likely to buy)
- Community can moderate itself (appoint trusted members as mods)

**Server Structure:**

**Text Channels:**
- #announcements (read-only, dev posts only)
- #general (open discussion)
- #strategy-discussion (players share tips, optimal schedules, emergent stories)
- #feedback (constructive criticism, feature requests)
- #bug-reports (with template: "Game version, OS, description, screenshot if possible")
- #showcase (players share their network legacy scores, favorite shows, dramatic moments)
- #off-topic (non-game chat)

**Voice Channels:**
- General voice (optional, some communities use it for co-working streams or just hanging out)

**Roles:**
- Developer (you)
- Moderator (trusted community members)
- Beta Tester (players with beta access)
- Member (default)

**Moderation Rules:**
- Be respectful. No harassment, hate speech, spam.
- Keep feedback constructive.
- No piracy discussion.
- Developer has final say, but we're here to listen.

**Engagement:**
- Pop in daily, even just to say "hey" or react to posts
- Weekly dev update (every Friday)
- Ask questions: "We're debating whether to let you fire showrunners mid-season. Thoughts?"
- Feature community content: "This player built a network with zero comedies and won 8 Emmys. Here's their strat."

**Launch invite link:**
- Add to Steam page: "Join the community: [Discord link]"
- Add to Twitter bio
- Add to in-game demo end screen

### 7.2 Steam Community Hub

**Post regularly:**
- Dev diaries (bi-weekly or monthly)
- Patch notes (every update)
- Feature spotlights: "Let's talk about the talent system. Here's how it works and why we designed it this way."

**Engage in forums:**
- Respond to bug reports within 24 hours
- Respond to positive reviews with "Thank you, glad you're enjoying it."
- Respond to negative reviews respectfully: "Sorry you're not enjoying X. We're looking at feedback on that system. What would make it better for you?"

### 7.3 Subreddit (Stretch Goal)

**r/PremiereGame** — If the game gets big enough (5K+ players), consider creating a subreddit.

**Pros:**
- Centralized community
- Good for strategy guides, memes, emergent storytelling
- Self-moderating if community is healthy

**Cons:**
- Requires active moderation
- Splits community between Discord and Reddit
- Only worth it if there's critical mass

**Recommendation:** Wait until post-launch. If the community is large and active on Discord, *they* will probably create the subreddit organically. Join as a mod if they do.

---

## 8. Influencer and Content Creator Strategy

Influencers are not ads. They're amplifiers. One 20-minute video from the right creator is worth 50 paid ads.

### 8.1 Target Creators (Detailed)

**Tier 1 (Prioritize, Quality Over Quantity):**

1. **Wanderbots (180K subs)**
   - Why: Specializes in strategy and simulation. His audience is YOUR audience.
   - Content style: Calm, analytical, focuses on mechanics
   - Reach out: Month 9 (alpha keys), Month 14 (beta keys)

2. **SplatterCatGaming (500K subs)**
   - Why: "Indie game showcase" is his whole brand. He covers everything and his audience trusts his curation.
   - Content style: Energetic, first-impressions, 20-30 min videos
   - Reach out: Month 10 (Next Fest demo), Month 16 (launch)

3. **Pravus Gaming (200K subs)**
   - Why: Grand strategy, deep sims, management games. His audience likes COMPLEX.
   - Content style: Long-form series (10+ episodes), very analytical
   - Reach out: Month 14 (beta), offer early access for a full series

**Tier 2 (Broader Outreach, Cast a Wide Net):**

- Retromation, Aliensrock, DasTactic, quill18, EnterElysium (all 50K-150K subs, all cover management sims)
- Reach out to 10-15 creators in this tier. Expect 3-5 to cover it.

**Tier 3 (Micro-Influencers, High Engagement):**

- Creators with 5K-20K subs who focus on tycoon games
- Find them by searching YouTube for "Game Dev Tycoon," "Software Inc.," "management sim 2024"
- They have small audiences but VERY engaged (comments, Discord, Patreon supporters)
- Reach out to 20-30. Expect 10-15 to cover it.

### 8.2 Outreach Email Template

```
Subject: Early access key for PREMIERE (TV network management sim)

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], developer of PREMIERE, a management sim where you run a TV network in the 2000s golden age. I've been watching your [Game Dev Tycoon / Software Inc. / etc.] videos and I think this might be up your alley.

**The pitch:** Greenlight pilots, drag show cards onto a weekly scheduling grid, read Nielsen ratings, manage talent, and decide: Emmys or eyeballs?

**Why I think you'll like it:**
- Deep systems (lead-in effects, demographic targeting, competitive AI)
- Emergent storytelling (every show is AI-generated, no two playthroughs the same)
- It's Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men

I'd love to send you a key (game is in [alpha/beta/launch], so expect [some rough edges / polished experience]). No strings attached. If it's not your thing, no worries. But if you dig it and want to make a video, that would be amazing.

Trailer: [link]
Steam: [link]

Let me know if you're interested.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Studio Name]
[Email / Twitter]
```

### 8.3 What to Send Them

- **Steam key** (obviously)
- **One-sheet PDF** with hook, controls, key features (optional, some creators prefer to discover organically)
- **Discord invite** (if they want to report bugs or ask questions)

**What NOT to send:**
- A script for their video (they know their audience better than you)
- Specific requirements ("Please mention the Steam page in the first 30 seconds") — this turns it into an ad, not authentic coverage
- Pressure ("When will your video go live?") — let them work at their own pace

### 8.4 Tracking and Follow-Up

- Spreadsheet: Creator name, subscriber count, email sent date, key sent (Y/N), video published (Y/N), video link, views
- If a creator makes a video: Thank them publicly on Twitter (quote-retweet their video with "Thank you for covering PREMIERE")
- If a creator doesn't make a video: That's fine. No follow-up spam. Maybe they didn't vibe with it. Move on.

---

## 9. Paid Advertising Strategy (Optional)

Paid ads are OPTIONAL for indie games. Organic marketing (press, influencers, wishlists) is higher ROI. But if you have budget ($1K-$5K), here's where to spend it.

### 9.1 Where to Advertise

**1. Reddit Promoted Posts ($500-$1000):**
- Target subreddits: r/tycoon, r/pcgaming, r/Games
- Post format: Native ad (looks like a Reddit post, labeled "Promoted")
- Creative: The Board GIF + headline: "Run a TV network in the 2000s. Schedule shows, read ratings, decide: Emmys or eyeballs?"
- CTA: "Wishlist on Steam"
- Budget: $20-$50 per day for 1-2 weeks around announcement or launch

**2. Twitter Promoted Tweets ($300-$500):**
- Promote your best-performing organic tweet (the one with highest engagement)
- Target: Interests = "PC gaming," "indie games," "management simulation," "Game Dev Tycoon," "strategy games"
- Budget: $10-$20 per day for 1-2 weeks

**3. YouTube Pre-Roll Ads ($500-$1000, Stretch Budget):**
- Run your 30-second trailer as a skippable pre-roll ad
- Target: Viewers of Game Dev Tycoon, Software Inc., Football Manager videos
- This is expensive and only worth it if you have a polished trailer and $1K to burn

**4. Steam's Built-In Visibility Rounds (FREE):**
- When you launch, Steam gives you automatic visibility in the "New & Trending" tab
- Your launch discount (10-15% off first week) boosts this
- DO NOT pay for external ads on launch week — let Steam's algorithm work first

### 9.2 Budget Recommendation

**If you have $0 for ads:** Focus 100% on organic. Press, influencers, Twitter, Reddit, Discord. This is enough.

**If you have $1K-$2K:** Reddit promoted posts around announcement and launch. That's it.

**If you have $5K+:** Reddit + Twitter + YouTube. But honestly, spend that money on a better trailer or hiring a community manager instead.

## 10. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Marketing without metrics is guessing. Here's what to track and what success looks like.

### 10.1 Wishlist Targets (Steam)

| Milestone | Target | Realistic | Stretch |

| **Launch (Month 17)** | 15,000 total | 25,000 | 40,000 |

**Why wishlists matter:**
- Steam's algorithm prioritizes games with high wishlist velocity (wishlists added per day)

- 5,000 units = $87,500
- 10,000 units = $175,000
- 20,000 units = $350,000

### 10.5 Review Score Targets

- **Steam:** 80%+ positive ("Very Positive") in first month
- **Metacritic** (if applicable): 75+ average score

## 13. Post-Launch Content Strategy

Launch is not the finish line. It's the starting gun.

### 13.1 Patch Roadmap (First 90 Days)

**Patch 1.1 (Week 2):**
- Critical bug fixes from launch week
- UI polish (anything players consistently complained about)
- Balance tweaks (if a genre is over/underpowered)

**Patch 1.2 (Month 2):**
- Quality-of-life features: faster simulation speed toggle, UI scaling options, colorblind mode improvements
- New content: 20 additional pilot premise templates (keeps AI generation fresh)

**Patch 1.3 (Month 3):**
- Community-requested features (poll Discord/Reddit: "What do you want to see?")
- Possible additions: "Fire the showrunner" option, "International syndication" revenue stream, "Awards campaign" mini-game (if it was cut from v1)

### 13.2 Free Content Updates (Months 6-12)

**Update 1: "The Streaming Wars" (Month 6-8):**
- Extend timeline to 2015
- Add streaming networks as competitors (they don't follow the same rules: no weekly schedule, binge releases, algorithm-driven recommendations)
- New challenge: Can you survive as a broadcast network when Netflix is poaching your talent?

**Update 2: "International Markets" (Month 10-12):**
- Add syndication revenue (completed shows generate passive income)
- Add format sales (sell your hit show's format to foreign networks)
- New complexity: Long-term thinking is even more rewarded

### 13.3 Paid DLC (Month 18-24, Optional)

**DLC: "The Streaming Wars — Play as the Disruptor"**
- New game mode: You RUN a Netflix-style streaming service
- Different mechanics: no weekly schedule, binge releases, algorithm tuning, no ad revenue (subscription model), poach broadcast talent
- Price: $9.99
- Sell it as a "what-if" expansion — play the other side of the PREMIERE story

### 13.4 Community Events (Ongoing)

**Monthly Challenge (Discord/Twitter):**
- "Build a network with zero reality shows and reach 10M average viewers"
- "Win 5 Emmys in a single season"
- "Survive the writers' strike with a profit"
- Winners get featured on Twitter, maybe a "Legendary Executive" badge in-game

**Annual "Best Network" Contest:**
- Players submit their legacy scores
- Community votes on best network
- Winner's network is added to the game as an AI rival in the next update

## 14. HYPE's Closing Note

Look. I've given you the roadmap. The hooks, the beats, the timelines, the tactics. But here's the part that doesn't go in a document: marketing is not a checklist. It's a conversation that starts the day you write your first line of code and doesn't end until the last player uninstalls.

You're not selling a product. You're building a relationship. Every tweet, every devlog, every response to a Steam review is a chance to show people that you care about what you made — and that you care about THEM.

The games that break out are not always the best games. They're the games that found their audience early, spoke to them honestly, and made them feel invested BEFORE launch. PREMIERE has that potential. The hook is strong. The market is open. The audience is waiting.

But you have to start NOW. The Steam page goes live the moment The Board GIF exists. Twitter starts the day you have something to show. The conversation begins before the game is done.

And when someone tweets "I just cancelled a show I loved because the ratings were trash and I feel like a monster" — quote-retweet it. That's not just engagement. That's proof the game is working.

What's the GIF? The GIF is a hand dragging a show card onto Thursday at 9 PM while the overnight ratings slide in and everything ripples. That's the scroll-stop. That's the hook. That's PREMIERE.

Now go build the audience.

**END OF MARKETING PLAN**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create The Board GIF (Month 1-2 of development)
2. Set up Twitter account and Steam page (Month 4)
3. Begin bi-weekly devlog series (Month 5)
4. Prepare announcement trailer (Month 6-7)
5. Launch press outreach (Month 7)
6. Build Steam Next Fest demo (Month 8-10)
7. Execute launch (Month 17)

**Questions for the Team:**
- Do we have budget for paid ads? ($1K-$5K would help, but organic is enough if budget is $0)
- Who is handling community management? (Discord moderation, Steam review responses) — This should be you or a dedicated CM, not an afterthought
- Are we doing a publisher or self-publishing? (Publisher can help with press reach but takes 30-50% revenue)
