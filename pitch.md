# PREMIERE — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets 30 Rock meets Mad Men — on a broadcast scheduling grid**

*You're a network executive in the 2000s golden age of television. Greenlight pilots, schedule your lineup, crush the competition in the ratings, and decide the question that defined an era: prestige or popularity?*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Run a cable TV network in the 2000s golden age of television — greenlight AI-generated shows, schedule them against real competitors, manage diva talent, survive sweeps week, and answer the only question that matters: do you chase Emmys or eyeballs?**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "Your critically acclaimed drama just lost to a CSI rerun. Again. Do you move it to Sundays or cancel it forever?"

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

The player stares at a scheduling grid — a wide magnetic board, fluorescent-lit, covered in show cards with tiny headshots and genre icons. It looks exactly like the boards real network executives used in the 2000s to build a weekly lineup. The player drags a buzzy new legal drama into the Thursday 9 PM slot, right against a competitor's monster procedural. The overnight ratings come in: 8.2 million viewers. Not bad. But the competitor pulled 14.6 million. The phone rings — it's the showrunner, demanding a better slot. A pop-up: the lead actress just got arrested. Another pop-up: the critics love it. Metacritic score: 87. A third pop-up: advertisers are threatening to pull because of "controversial content." The player grins, moves the card to Tuesday 10 PM, and greenlights a cheap reality show to absorb the Thursday death match.

**That's the GIF. A hand dragging show cards on a glowing scheduling board while chaos erupts around it. That's PREMIERE.**

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Fantasy

The player wants to feel like the most powerful person in entertainment — the one who decides what America watches. You sit in a corner office, you look at a board of show cards, and every decision you make determines whether a show lives, dies, becomes a cultural phenomenon, or gets burned off on Fridays to die in silence. You are the tastemaker and the executioner. The fantasy is control — and the slow, exhilarating realization that control is an illusion.

### Core Loop

**30-second loop (The Move):** Pick up a show card, look at its stats — genre, demo skew, quality rating, lead-in compatibility, cost per episode — and place it on the weekly grid. Every placement is a bet. Does the 18-49 male audience from your 8 PM action show carry over into your 9 PM legal drama? Does your Friday comedy have any chance against the competitors' movie night? Each card placed changes the calculus of every adjacent slot.

**5-minute loop (The Week):** Once the schedule is set, the week simulates. Overnight ratings arrive show by show. You see your numbers against the competition. Notes pile up: talent demands, advertiser reactions, critical reviews, fan campaigns, network president pressure. You respond — adjust the schedule, greenlight a midseason replacement, order more episodes, cancel a dog. Spend your development budget scouting pilots from the incoming pile.

**30-minute loop (The Season):** A TV season runs from September to May. You navigate upfronts (where advertisers buy time based on your pitch), sweeps months (November, February, May — when ratings count most), midseason launches, finale stacking, and summer burn-off. Each season ends with an Emmy ceremony and an annual performance review. Did you grow the network? Did you win prestige? Did you keep your job?

**Meta loop (The Career):** Across multiple seasons, you build a network identity. Are you the prestige network (HBO-style)? The populist juggernaut (CBS-style)? The edgy upstart (FX-style)? Your track record attracts certain showrunners, certain talent, certain advertisers. Reputation compounds. A single era spans roughly 2000-2012, from the post-Sopranos gold rush to the streaming cliff. The game ends when the world changes beneath you.

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Grid (Scheduling System)** — A drag-and-drop weekly programming grid, 8 PM to 11 PM, Monday through Sunday. Each slot holds one show card. Adjacency matters: lead-in/lead-out audience flow, genre stacking, demographic counterprogramming. The grid IS the game. Moving a card from Wednesday to Thursday is a strategic decision with cascading consequences. The interface is a period-authentic magnetic scheduling board — white, clean, tactile — with show cards that have worn edges and coffee-ring stains.

2. **The Pilot Pipeline (Development System)** — Every season, AI generates a pool of pilot scripts with procedural properties: genre, subgenre, quality ceiling, audience floor, demographic skew (18-49, 25-54, female skew, male skew, urban, rural), showrunner reputation, lead talent attachment, estimated cost per episode, critical potential (award bait vs. crowd pleaser), and network fit score. You greenlight a limited number based on your development budget. Some pilots test well with audiences and bomb with critics. Some test terribly and become cult phenomena. The pipeline is where long-term strategy lives — you are planting seeds two seasons ahead.

3. **The Talent Web (Relationship System)** — Showrunners, actors, writers, and directors are persistent AI-driven entities with personalities, egos, career trajectories, and inter-personal dynamics. A showrunner whose last show you cancelled holds a grudge. A lead actress whose contract is up demands an executive producer credit. The head writer threatens to leave if you move the show from its prestige Tuesday slot. Stars become divas. Stars become has-beens. Stars make comebacks. Managing talent is managing a web of leverage, loyalty, and ego — every favor owed is a lever you can pull later.

4. **The Ratings Engine (Competition System)** — Three rival networks operate simultaneously with their own AI-driven scheduling logic. They counterprogramm against you. They poach your talent. They clone your hits. Nielsen overnights arrive after each simulated week, breaking down your performance by timeslot, demographic, and total viewers. The ratings engine models audience behavior: channel surfing, DVR usage (increasingly relevant as the 2000s progress), lead-in decay, event viewing spikes, and seasonal variation. You don't just schedule against yourself — you schedule against the entire landscape.

5. **The Ledger (Business System)** — Advertising revenue per show is a function of ratings, demographics, and brand safety. High-rated shows with young demos command premium CPMs. Controversial prestige dramas scare advertisers. Cheap reality shows have enormous margins. You manage a network budget: development spending, marketing pushes, talent contracts, timeslot promotion. Go too prestige and the accountants revolt. Go too populist and the industry laughs. The ledger is the tension made tangible — every dollar is a vote for what kind of network you are.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner puts their best show in the best timeslot and hopes. An expert builds a **flow architecture** — a Thursday night lineup where the 8 PM broad comedy feeds into the 9 PM ensemble drama which feeds into the 10 PM edgy thriller, each show's ending demographic matching the next show's opening demographic. The expert knows that a 6-million-viewer show in the Thursday 9 PM slot against weak competition is more valuable than a 9-million-viewer show on Monday against a competitor's flagship. The expert greenlights a mediocre reality show specifically to absorb a kamikaze timeslot, protecting their prestige dramas from direct warfare. The expert manages a showrunner's ego for three seasons to get the fourth season that wins the Emmy. The expert sees the scheduling grid not as a puzzle but as a living ecosystem where every change ripples outward.

### Unique Mechanic: The Board

The scheduling grid — **The Board** — is the single unifying interface. Real network executives literally stand in front of magnetic whiteboards moving show cards around. PREMIERE makes that physicality the core interaction. It is not a menu. It is a spatial, tactile, strategic object. Every other system feeds into or out of The Board: pilots become cards, talent attaches to cards, ratings flow from card placement, advertisers buy against card performance. The Board is to PREMIERE what the desktop is to LAN PARTY — the entire game expressed through a single, period-authentic interface metaphor. No other management sim has made the act of *scheduling* — the exact order and position of content in a weekly grid — the core strategic verb.

### Depth Stress-Test

- **Hour 1:** You have five shows and a half-empty grid. You learn adjacency, lead-ins, and demographic basics. Your first sweeps week is a scramble. The interface is charming and intuitive.
- **Hour 20:** You're running 18 shows across seven nights. Three are on the bubble. A rival network just launched a clone of your hit procedural. Your best showrunner wants a raise and your accountants want blood. You start seeing The Board like a chess board — every move has three counter-moves.
- **Hour 100:** You've built a network identity across five seasons. You've launched a show that started with 4 million viewers, grew into a cultural phenomenon, won three Emmys, and you're now deciding whether to end it on a high or milk it for two more declining seasons. New pilots reference your old shows. Talent you fired three seasons ago is now running a competitor's hit. The 2000s are ending and DVR numbers are eating your live ratings. The game is asking: can you adapt, or are you the establishment now?

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**PREMIERE is about the tension between art and commerce — and the quiet tragedy of the person caught in between.**

Beneath the ratings and the scheduling grids, this is a game about what happens when the thing you love becomes the thing you sell. Every network executive started as someone who loved television. They watched a show that changed their life — something raw, something true — and they thought, *I want to make that possible.* Then they got the corner office, and the corner office asked them: would you rather air something beautiful that nobody watches, or something disposable that everyone does?

Every mechanic tells this story. The scheduling grid tells the story of scarcity — there are only so many slots and infinite ambition. The ratings engine tells the story of democracy at its most brutal — the audience votes every night, and they don't care about your vision. The talent web tells the story of art made by humans with egos, addictions, broken marriages, and desperate need for validation. The ledger tells the story of the machine that art must feed to survive.

The player is not a villain. The player is not a hero. The player is the person who decides, every single day, how much of their soul the schedule gets to eat.

### The World

It is the 2000s, and television is in its golden age, though nobody has named it that yet. The Sopranos proved that TV could be art. American Idol proved that TV could be a money printer. The gap between those two truths is where the player lives.

The world is experienced through the artifacts of the era: scheduling boards under fluorescent lights, Variety headlines sliding across the bottom of the screen, upfront presentations in gilded ballrooms where advertisers clap politely at sizzle reels, writer's room whiteboards covered in index cards and dry-erase timelines, craft service tables on soundstages. You never see a living room where someone watches your shows. You only see the machine that makes them.

The wound of this world is **the cliff it cannot see coming.** Netflix is a DVD-by-mail company. YouTube is a dating site. The iPhone doesn't exist. Every character in this world is building empires on a foundation that will be rubble in ten years. They don't know. The player knows. And the player has to build anyway — because the only alternative to building on shifting ground is not building at all.

### The Player's Emotional Arc

**Beginning:** Power fantasy. The grid is yours. You're greenlighting shows, moving cards, watching ratings roll in. You feel clever. You feel important. The 2000s are bright and loud and yours to command.

**Middle:** Weight. Your favorite show — the one the AI generated with the perfect cast and the heartbreaking premise — is dying at 10 PM on Wednesdays. You could save it by moving it. But moving it means killing something else. The showrunner calls. They're exhausted. They ask you: *do you believe in this show?* And you realize the answer matters — not for the ratings, but for you. Who are you when you hold someone's art in your hands?

**End:** Reckoning. The era is closing. DVRs have fractured your audience. A writers' strike has gutted your development pipeline. Reality TV is cheap and dominant and soulless. You look at your network's legacy — the shows you greenlit, the ones you cancelled too early, the one you let run two seasons too long. Some of them mattered. Some of them were compromises. The game doesn't judge you. It shows you the schedule you built, season by season, and lets you judge yourself.

### Story Hook

**"You just got the corner office. The last executive was fired for losing sweeps. The board wants ratings. The showrunners want freedom. The audience wants everything and nothing. You have 22 timeslots and 40 pilots. What does America watch this fall?"**

### Characters (Persistent AI-driven, unique each playthrough)

- **The Auteur:** A showrunner who writes like a poet and misses every deadline. Their show is extraordinary. Their behavior is impossible. They need protection from the network and from themselves. *What's the lie they tell themselves? That art justifies everything.*

- **The Machine:** A showrunner who delivers reliable, formulaic procedurals that rate well and win nothing. They are pleasant, professional, and utterly without creative risk. They are the backbone of your network and they know it. *Who are they when no one's watching? Someone who wanted to make something great once, and stopped trying.*

- **The Star:** An actor who started in a supporting role and became the face of your network. Their contract negotiation will define your next three seasons. They are charming in public and brutal in private. *What do they want? To be taken seriously. What do they need? To be told they're enough.*

- **The Heir:** A young development executive climbing the ranks who sees everything you do and is learning from it — learning what kind of executive to become. They are your mirror. *Where does the world crack for them? When they realize that being good at this job and being a good person might be different things.*

- **The Ghost:** A showrunner whose brilliant, cancelled-too-early show from five years ago still has a cult following online. They pitch you a new project every season. It's always too weird, too expensive, too risky. But it's always good. *What aren't they saying? That the cancellation broke something in them that a greenlight might fix.*

- **The Suit:** Your boss. The network president who answers to the parent company. They want quarterly growth. They speak in corporate euphemisms. They are not a villain — they are a person trapped by a system that measures everything except the thing that matters. *What do they need? Permission to care.*

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Adults 25-45 who are obsessed with the "golden age of television" and the business behind it. They've watched every behind-the-scenes documentary about The Sopranos, Lost, and The Wire. They have opinions about NBC's Thursday night lineup. They read Bill Carter's *The War for Late Night.* They play management sims and tycoon games. They hang out on r/television, r/tycoon, r/gameDev, and Film Twitter.

**Secondary:** Management sim and tycoon enthusiasts (18-35) who play Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Software Inc. They want a new industry to optimize. The television industry is rich, dramatic, and untapped in gaming.

**Tertiary:** Casual strategy players (30-50) who loved the creative decision-making in Hollywood-adjacent games and want something deeper than mobile empire builders. They watch Succession, The Morning Show, and Studio 60 and think: *I could do better.*

### Comparable Games

1. **"If Game Dev Tycoon met 30 Rock"** — The tycoon structure of building a creative empire, but the product you're managing is episodic television with personalities, politics, and the constant absurdity of show business. The tone walks the line between strategic depth and workplace comedy.

2. **"If Football Manager met Mad Men"** — The obsessive, spreadsheet-deep management of Football Manager, but instead of scouting strikers you're scouting showrunners, and instead of league tables you're staring at Nielsen overnights. The drama is interpersonal, not athletic.

3. **"If Civilization met The Larry Sanders Show"** — Civilization's "one more turn" compulsion applied to "one more week of ratings," with the human messiness of a show about the entertainment industry. You build a legacy across eras, but the eras are TV seasons and the units are sitcoms and dramas.

4. **"If Software Inc. met Entourage"** — The company-building depth of Software Inc. transplanted into the high-ego, high-stakes world of network television, where your employees are creative geniuses, volatile stars, and ruthless executives.

5. **"If Papers, Please met Network (1976)"** — The moral weight of bureaucratic decision-making applied to the entertainment industry. Every show you schedule or cancel is a small moral choice with big consequences. The system is indifferent. You don't have to be.

### Unique Selling Proposition

**No management sim has ever tackled the television industry with this depth — and no game has ever made the scheduling grid the core mechanic.** Game Dev Tycoon proved that players love managing creative industries. Football Manager proved that players will obsess over systems management when the fiction is compelling. PREMIERE sits at the intersection: **a tycoon game where the product is culture, the interface is iconic, and the AI generates infinite television for you to manage.** The 2000s TV nostalgia wave (reboots, retrospectives, oral histories) proves the audience is primed. The management sim market is hungry for new industries. Television — with its weekly rhythms, demographic warfare, talent drama, and cultural stakes — is the perfect unexploited setting.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)** — Primary. The scheduling grid interface is mouse-native. The management sim audience lives on Steam. Tags hit multiple high-traffic categories: Simulation, Strategy, Management, Tycoon, Singleplayer. This game will surface to wishlists of Game Dev Tycoon, Software Inc., and Production Line players immediately.

**Steam Deck** — Strong secondary. The grid interface translates to touchscreen. Session length (30-minute seasons) is perfect for portable play.

**Console (Switch, PlayStation, Xbox)** — Post-launch port. The grid works with a cursor. The 2000s TV nostalgia transcends platform. Switch in particular skews toward the cozy-management audience.

**Mobile** — Cut. The interface density and strategic depth don't compress to phone screens. Don't chase it.

---

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **The Board (Scheduling Grid)** — The drag-and-drop weekly programming grid is the primary interface and core mechanic. Monday through Sunday, 8 PM through 11 PM. Show cards with visible stats. Adjacency logic for lead-in/lead-out flow. Counterprogramming against visible rival schedules. This IS the game. If The Board doesn't feel satisfying to interact with — tactile, readable, strategic — nothing else matters.

2. **The Pilot Pipeline (AI Show Generation)** — Every season, the game generates a pool of original television shows with procedural properties: title, premise, genre, subgenre, cast quality, showrunner attachment, demographic skew, quality ceiling, audience floor, cost per episode, critical potential, and cultural volatility. Shows evolve over seasons — quality rises or declines, casts change, audiences grow or erode. No two playthroughs generate the same television landscape. The shows must feel like real TV — players should read a pilot description and think, "I'd watch that."

3. **The Ratings Engine (Competition and Audience Simulation)** — Three AI-driven rival networks with their own scheduling logic, development pipelines, and strategic tendencies. Nielsen overnight ratings simulate audience behavior: channel surfing, habitual viewing, lead-in effects, DVR time-shifting, event spikes, seasonal variation, and demographic segmentation. The player competes against a living landscape, not a static benchmark.

4. **The Talent Web (Character and Relationship System)** — Persistent AI-driven showrunners, actors, writers, and executives with personalities, egos, reputations, career arcs, and interpersonal dynamics. They remember your decisions. They hold grudges. They grow. They decline. They leave. They come back. The talent is what makes the television industry human — without it, this is a spreadsheet.

5. **The Era Arc (2000-2012 Progression)** — The game spans the golden age of television from the post-Sopranos moment to the pre-streaming cliff. Industry conditions evolve: DVR adoption erodes live ratings, reality TV explodes, the writers' strike of 2007-2008 devastates scripted development, cable networks start competing for prestige, and the first rumblings of streaming appear on the horizon. The era is not set dressing — it is a slowly shifting strategic landscape that forces the player to adapt or die.

### Stretch Goals (Ordered by Impact)

1. **Upfront Presentation System** — A playable sequence each May where you pitch your fall schedule to advertisers. Choose which shows to highlight, which clips to play, which stars to bring onstage. Advertiser confidence determines your revenue ceiling for the season. Nail the upfront and you buy yourself breathing room. Botch it and you're running on fumes.

2. **The Writers' Room** — A deeper layer for show development where you can influence a show's creative direction: push for serialized storytelling vs. episodic structure, encourage character death for shock value, demand a "very special episode" for sweeps. Each intervention has consequences — showrunners resist micromanagement, but sometimes the network note saves the show.

3. **Awards Season Campaign** — A mini-game around Emmy campaigning. Spend marketing budget on "For Your Consideration" ads. Host screening events. Manage press interviews with volatile talent. Winning awards has concrete mechanical effects: talent retention, showrunner attraction, advertiser prestige premiums, and network brand elevation.

4. **Syndication and Afterlife** — Cancelled and completed shows enter syndication, generating passive revenue based on episode count and cultural footprint. A show that ran seven seasons and became a cultural touchstone pays dividends for decades. A show cancelled after six episodes vanishes. This system rewards long-term thinking and makes the cancellation decision even more agonizing.

5. **The Network Notes System** — Write actual notes on show scripts that affect development. "Make the lead more likable." "Add a love triangle." "Can we get a Thanksgiving episode?" Each note has a probability of improving ratings and a probability of destroying the showrunner's vision. The system literalizes the network executive's impossible job: you have to give notes, but every note is a potential wound.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Playable episodes** — You watch ratings, not television. You never see the shows. The shows live as cards, numbers, and descriptions. This constraint is a feature: the player's imagination fills in the gaps.
- **Real licensed shows** — Use AI-generated shows with procedural titles and premises. No licensing headaches. Parody is legal and funnier ("CSI: Toledo," "Survivor: Accounting," "The Bachelorette: Witness Protection").
- **News division simulation** — Too complex, different business model, deserves its own game.
- **International markets** — v1 is domestic US broadcast. International syndication and format sales are stretch territory.
- **Multiplayer competitive** — The scheduling grid is a single-player strategy experience. Async leaderboards (highest-rated network across a season) are stretch, but head-to-head multiplayer distorts the design.
- **Pre-2000 eras** — The 1990s, 1980s, and network television's birth are fascinating but demand entirely different content generation and competitive landscapes. Expansion territory, not v1.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

### Primary Image

A wide scheduling board under harsh fluorescent light, slightly angled — the perspective of someone standing in front of it at 2 AM. Show cards pinned across the grid, some with red X marks (cancelled), some with gold stars (award-winning), some with question marks (on the bubble). A hand reaches in from the right side of the frame, holding a show card, about to place it. In the blurred background: a corner office window showing a Manhattan skyline at night. On a desk behind the board: a cold cup of coffee, a stack of Nielsen printouts, a ringing phone with the light blinking. The feeling: power, isolation, and the weight of a decision that hasn't been made yet.

### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Fluorescent white (#F5F5F0) — the flat, institutional light of a network office
- **Accent 1:** Nielsen blue (#1A3C6E) — the cold authority of ratings data, overnight printouts, corporate presentations
- **Accent 2:** Prestige gold (#C5A55A) — Emmy statuettes, upfront ballroom chandeliers, the warm glow of critical acclaim
- **Accent 3:** Ratings red (#D4382C) — cancellation stamps, declining trend lines, the urgency of sweeps week underperformance
- **Accent 4:** Money green (#2D7A3A) — advertising revenue, budget surplus, the network's bottom line
- **Background:** Mahogany dark (#3B1E0E) — executive office wood paneling, the weight of the industry, old-money television
- **Highlight:** Pilot blue (#4A90D9) — new development, fresh potential, the optimism of an untested show

### Typography

The logo should evoke early 2000s network branding — clean, authoritative, slightly serif. Think NBC's peacock-era wordmark or HBO's static intro. Not playful. Not ironic. The word PREMIERE in capitals, letter-spaced, with a subtle weight that says: this is serious business conducted by unserious people.

### Audio Mood

A score that splits between two tones: the bright, brassy confidence of an upfront presentation (horns, strings, the swell of a network's fall promo campaign) and the quiet, late-night tension of an executive alone with a scheduling board (minimal piano, the hum of fluorescent lights, the distant ring of a phone). Music cues shift based on performance — a winning season sounds like a victory lap; a losing season sounds like an office at 3 AM.

### Tone

**Sincere, not satirical.** This game loves television. It loves the people who make it, even when they're difficult. It loves the absurdity of the industry without mocking it. The humor comes from recognition, not contempt. When a showrunner throws a tantrum because you moved their show to Fridays, the game doesn't wink at you — it lets you feel the weight of what you just did and the ridiculousness of how they reacted, simultaneously. Think Aaron Sorkin's respect for the craft meets Tina Fey's awareness of the machine.

## OPEN QUESTIONS & NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]

- What's the right simulation speed? Real-time with controls (like The Sims) or turn-based week-by-week (like Football Manager)? The weekly rhythm of television suggests turn-based, but the mid-week chaos of breaking news and talent drama might demand real-time within a week.
- How granular should demographic simulation be? Age/gender breakdowns are essential. Income, education, geography — do they add strategic depth or just noise? Start with the 18-49 demo (the one advertisers actually buy) and expand from there.
- How does the AI generate shows that feel distinct and real across 100+ hours? What are the genre templates? How many premise structures? Can the system combine tropes in ways that surprise the player or will it start feeling formulaic by season five?
- Should the player be able to influence show content (give notes, demand changes) or only manage the business side? The "network notes" system is powerful but risks scope creep. Where's the line?
- How does DVR adoption mechanically change the game between 2000 and 2012? This is a slow-motion strategic earthquake. The answer defines the late-game.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]

- How do we make the player care about shows that are just cards and numbers? Environmental storytelling — Variety headlines about your shows, fan forum posts, watercooler dialogue overheard in the office — can make the shows feel real without ever showing them. How much is enough?
- Where is the player's personal story? Are they a character with a home life, or a ghost? The corner office is lonely. Does the game acknowledge that?
- How do we handle the writers' strike of 2007-2008 as a narrative event? It's the most significant industry disruption of the era. It should be a crucible, not a footnote. But it involves real labor politics. How direct do we get?
- What's the emotional relationship between the player and a show they cancel? Cancellation should *sting.* The showrunner's reaction, the fan campaign, the cast's farewell interviews. Every cancellation is a small death. The game needs to make you feel it without making it paralyzing.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]

- The announcement trailer should be a fake network upfront presentation — a sizzle reel of "shows" on your "network" presented with the breathless enthusiasm of a real May upfront. End with: "You greenlit all of this. You scheduled all of this. You cancelled half of it." Cut to the scheduling grid. Logo. Wishlist.
- The demo should be a single Fall season — September to November sweeps. Enough to feel the core loop, experience one cancellation decision, and see overnight ratings. This is a perfect Steam Next Fest demo: self-contained, replayable, hook-driven.
- This game markets itself on Twitter/X to TV obsessives. A daily "your AI-generated network schedule" screenshot post will go viral with the TV criticism community. Build the audience in the space where people already argue about programming decisions.
- Festival circuit: PAX West, Day of the Devs, Indie MEGABOOTH. This game demos beautifully — the scheduling grid is immediately readable and the "what show goes where" decision is universally understandable.
- What's the hook in 5 seconds? A hand moving a show card on a scheduling grid while Nielsen numbers tick upward. That's the GIF. That's the Steam capsule. Show the GAME, not the features.

### Next Steps

1. Prototype The Board — the scheduling grid interface with placeholder show cards and basic adjacency logic. If dragging cards and reading the grid isn't immediately satisfying, nothing else matters. What's the loop? The loop is The Board.
2. Build the Ratings Engine on paper — model audience flow between timeslots, demographic segmentation, and competitive counterprogramming. Validate with real historical Nielsen data from the 2000s.
3. Prototype AI show generation — build the template system that creates shows with coherent premises, genre-appropriate stats, and names that sound like real television.
4. Write the Talent Web architecture — define the personality system, relationship graph, and event trigger logic for showrunners, actors, and executives.
5. Build one playable Fall season — September to November sweeps. Five shows, three timeslots per night, one rival network. This is the vertical slice and the demo.
6. Steam page goes live the moment The Board GIF exists. Start building the audience NOW.
