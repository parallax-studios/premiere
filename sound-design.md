## 0. ECHO's Note

Close your eyes. What do you hear?

Fluorescent lights humming at 120 Hz. The distant murmur of voices through office walls. A phone ringing that no one answers. The subtle click of a show card being placed on a magnetic board. The rustle of overnight Nielsen printouts. Coffee being poured at 2 AM. The low brass swell of an upfront presentation. A showrunner's voice cracking when you tell them their show is cancelled.

Audio IS game feel.

Every management sim I've worked on makes the same mistake. They layer ambient loops underneath spreadsheets and call it atmosphere. But PREMIERE isn't a spreadsheet. PREMIERE is a scheduling board under fluorescent lights where every decision carries weight, where every card placement is a bet, where the phone rings with news that changes everything.

The audio in this game has one job: make the player's body respond before their mind catches up.

When they place a show card in Thursday at 9 PM — the death slot, the prestige slot, the slot that makes or breaks careers — they need to HEAR the weight of that decision. When overnight ratings arrive and their flagship just lost to a rerun, they need to HEAR the silence that follows bad news. When they greenlight a risky pilot from a showrunner they believe in, they need to HEAR the spark of possibility.

This document is the blueprint for that sound. Every frequency, every texture, every moment of deliberate silence. Audio isn't polish for PREMIERE. Audio is how the player feels power, pressure, triumph, and loss.

Listen to the space between.

## 1. Sonic Identity Statement

**PREMIERE sounds like a corner office at 3 AM — the hum of institutional power, the isolation of executive decisions, and the distant ghost of the audience you're trying to reach.**

The sonic identity sits at the intersection of three textures:

**1. Institutional Authority**
The clean, cold precision of corporate space. Fluorescent hum. Magnetic card snap. Phone ring with a particular mid-century timbre. The acoustic signature of a mahogany-paneled office. This is the sound of power — not glamorous, not warm, but real. The sound of rooms where decisions are made.

**2. Human Vulnerability**
The breath before a difficult phone call. The rustle of paper when hands are shaking. Coffee cup ceramic clink. A showrunner's voice on the other end of the line — tired, desperate, passionate. Voice cracks. The silence when someone is waiting for you to speak. This is the sound of the people on the other end of your decisions.

**3. The Machinery of Television**
The rhythmic pulse of broadcast — weekly cycles, seasonal arcs, the relentless march of overnight ratings. Ticker tape clatter of Nielsen data. The swelling orchestral bombast of an upfront sizzle reel. Applause from a live studio audience bleeding through walls. This is the sound of the industry — loud, brassy, manufactured enthusiasm covering up the fear beneath.

These three textures layer and shift depending on game state. During the calm of schedule-building, the institutional authority dominates — precise, tactile, focused. During ratings reveals, the machinery of television takes over — anticipatory, rhythmic, almost mechanical. During talent events — phone calls, negotiations, cancellation conversations — human vulnerability comes forward, intimate and uncomfortable.

**The keynote is silence.** Not the absence of sound, but the presence of negative space. The pause before you make a decision. The moment after bad news arrives. The empty timeslot on The Board. Silence in PREMIERE is a sound design choice, and it carries more emotional weight than any music cue.

## 2. Sonic Palette

### 2.1 Tone & Texture

**Primary Palette: Institutional Realism (2000s Network Office)**

The foundational soundscape is hyper-realistic, bordering on documentary. The player occupies a specific place and time — a cable network executive office in the 2000s — and the audio must be anchored to that reality.

**Key Textures:**
- **Fluorescent ambiance:** Constant 120 Hz electrical hum, low-level, barely perceptible but present in every quiet moment
- **HVAC breathe:** Subtle air circulation, the acoustic signature of a large building's climate control
- **Office murmur:** Distant voices through walls and closed doors, never intelligible but rhythmically present
- **Desk surfaces:** Wood, laminate, glass — each has a distinct resonance when cards are placed, papers are moved, coffee cups are set down
- **Phone systems:** The specific electronic ring of early-2000s office phones — not modern smartphone chirps, but the piercing two-tone landline ring
- **Paper texture:** Printouts, memos, scripts — the rustle, shuffle, and slide of physical documents

**Secondary Palette: Broadcast Spectacle (The Industry Machine)**

When the player moves beyond the office — during upfront presentations, Emmy ceremonies, ratings reveal montages — the palette expands into the manufactured grandeur of television events.

**Key Textures:**
- **Orchestral bombast:** Lush strings, bright brass, timpani rolls — the sound of network promo campaigns and upfront sizzle reels
- **Live audience:** Applause, laughter, gasps — sampled and processed to feel like it's bleeding through from a soundstage
- **Broadcast signal:** Subtle tape hiss, the warmth of analog video compression artifacts translated to audio (psychoacoustic suggestion of "this is television")
- **Data visualization sound:** The sonic translation of numbers — rising tones for ratings increases, descending tones for declines, rhythmic pulses for demographic data

**Tertiary Palette: Emotional Intimacy (The Human Cost)**

During high-stakes talent interactions — cancellation calls, contract negotiations, creative revolts — the mix collapses into intimate foreground focus.

**Key Textures:**
- **Phone proximity:** The specific EQ of a voice through a landline receiver — compressed, mid-range heavy, with telephone line noise
- **Breath and pause:** Audible inhales, hesitations, the rhythm of difficult conversations
- **Vocal performance nuance:** Voice texture changes based on emotional state — showrunner confidence vs. desperation, actor ego vs. vulnerability
- **Room tone shift:** The ambiance goes quieter, more claustrophobic, when a difficult conversation begins

**Forbidden Textures:**
- No modern UI sounds (no iOS notification chirps, no MacOS system beeps)
- No generic corporate stock music
- No laugh tracks or television content audio (we never hear the shows themselves — we only hear the business of making them)
- No ironic distance or parody sound effects (this game respects television)

### 2.2 Reference Tracks

**For Institutional Authority:**
- Atticus Ross & Trent Reznor — *The Social Network* score ("Hand Covers Bruise," "Intriguing Possibilities") — precise, cold, electronic drones suggesting power and calculation
- Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow — *Ex Machina* score — minimalist, sterile, the sound of rooms where decisions are made
- Jóhann Jóhannsson — *Arrival* score ("First Encounter") — slow-building tension through sustained tones
- Actual field recording references: Office ambiance from *Sound Ideas* Series 6000, fluorescent hum from any documentary about corporate space

**For Broadcast Spectacle:**
- John Williams — NBC News themes, Olympic fanfares — bright brass, aspirational orchestration
- Mike Post — TV theme songs (Law & Order, ER) — the sound of 2000s broadcast television
- Network upfront presentation music (search "NBC upfront 2005," "CBS upfront 2007" on YouTube for period-accurate bombast)
- Hans Zimmer — *Mad Men* trailer music — the aspirational sell of an industry selling aspiration

**For Emotional Intimacy:**
- Mica Levi — *Under the Skin* score ("Love") — uncomfortable proximity, raw vulnerability
- *The Sopranos* — therapy scene soundscapes — quiet rooms where difficult truths are spoken
- Actual phone conversation recordings (legal/licensed) — the EQ and compression of real landline calls

**For Overall Inspiration:**
- The diegetic sound design of *The Social Network* — every keystroke, every mouse click, every ambient detail contributes to the feeling of obsessive focus
- The adaptive music system of *Frostpunk* — emotional escalation tied directly to game state
- The UI sound design of *Into the Breach* — every action has a satisfying, distinct audio signature

## 3. SFX List (Organized by Category)

### 3.1 Core Interaction: The Board (Scheduling Grid)

These are the most-heard sounds in the game. They must be PERFECT. Satisfying, distinct, readable, and never tiresome.

#### Card Manipulation

**Card Pickup (from bench or board)**
- **Sound:** Light magnetic release, paper-on-laminate slide, subtle low-frequency "lift" transient
- **Duration:** 120-180ms
- **Variants:** 8 variants with slight pitch/timing variation to prevent machine-gun effect during rapid card movement
- **Frequency profile:** Mid-range dominant (400-2kHz), gentle low-end (80-120Hz) for weight
- **Feel:** Tactile but light, like lifting a laminated card from a magnetic surface

**Card Drag (while moving)**
- **Sound:** Continuous low-level papery rustle, very subtle magnetic "hum" (implying the card is hovering over the magnetic surface)
- **Duration:** Looping while card is held
- **Frequency profile:** High-frequency rustle (4-8kHz), extremely quiet (barely perceptible)
- **Feel:** Continuous feedback that the card is "active" without being intrusive

**Card Hover Over Slot (valid placement)**
- **Sound:** Gentle magnetic "attraction" tone, rising pitch (implying the slot is pulling the card)
- **Duration:** 80ms, triggered when card enters valid slot
- **Pitch:** Starts at 400Hz, rises to 600Hz over the duration
- **Feel:** Anticipatory, like the board is "ready" to receive the card

**Card Hover Over Slot (invalid placement)**
- **Sound:** Dull thud, no magnetic attraction, slightly lower pitch
- **Duration:** 100ms
- **Pitch:** 200-300Hz, no rise
- **Feel:** "Dead" — the slot doesn't want this card

**Card Placement (successful)**
- **Sound:** Satisfying magnetic "snap" + card settling on surface + subtle chime
- **Layers:**
  1. **Physical snap** (80-100ms): Magnetic attraction release, similar to closing a MacBook lid but softer
  2. **Card settle** (100-150ms): Paper/laminate coming to rest on the board
  3. **System confirmation** (200ms): Subtle bell-tone or chime (different pitch per genre — comedy higher, drama lower, reality mid-range)
- **Duration:** Total 380-450ms
- **Frequency profile:** Sharp transient (full spectrum), settling into warm mid-range (600-1.5kHz), chime at 800-2kHz depending on genre
- **Variants:** 12 variants across genre types — broad comedy, legal drama, prestige drama, reality, procedural, event series
- **Feel:** This is the money shot. This is the sound that says "you just made a decision." It should feel physically satisfying, like snapping a LEGO brick into place.

**Card Removal (cancellation or move)**
- **Sound:** Magnetic release with a slightly mournful quality, paper lift with more air/space
- **Duration:** 150-200ms
- **Frequency profile:** Similar to pickup but with a gentle pitch drop (600Hz to 450Hz), implying loss
- **Feel:** Emptiness. The slot is now vacant. There's a subtle weight to removing a card that wasn't there when placing it.

**Card Swap (two cards trading positions)**
- **Sound:** Double pickup + double placement in rapid sequence, slight "shuffle" texture
- **Duration:** 600ms total (300ms per card phase, overlapping)

### 3.7 Ambiance & Environmental Layers

These sounds are constant, looping, and spatial. They define the sonic environment the player occupies.

**Corner Office (default environment)**
- **Layers:**
  1. **Fluorescent hum** (120 Hz drone, very quiet, -35dB)
  2. **HVAC breathe** (low-frequency air movement, barely audible, rhythmic every 4 seconds)
  3. **Distant office murmur** (voices through walls, never intelligible, 300-1kHz bandpassed, -30dB)
  4. **Occasional footsteps in hallway** (random intervals, 20-60 seconds apart, muffled)
  5. **Distant phone ring** (other offices, not yours, random intervals)
- **Overall SPL:** Very quiet, -25 to -35dB relative to primary interaction sounds
- **Spatialization:** Stereo field, slight reverb suggesting large office space
- **Feel:** You are alone in a corner office, but the building is alive around you. Isolation within an institution.

**Late Night Office (after-hours variant)**

  3. **Glassware clink** (cocktail reception sounds)
  4. **Distant jazz trio** (hotel ballroom piano/bass/drums, very quiet background)
- **Feel:** Spectacle. Performance. You're selling a dream to advertisers.

**Soundstage (distant, during certain events)**
- **Layers:**
  1. **Muffled live audience** (laughter, applause bleeding through soundstage walls)
  2. **Equipment hum** (electrical infrastructure of a production facility)
- **Feel:** The shows are being made somewhere in this building. You never see them, but you hear the ghost of them.

## 4. Music Brief

### 4.1 Musical Identity

PREMIERE's music lives at the intersection of two opposing forces:

**1. The Confidence of the Sell**
Bright brass, lush strings, the aspirational swell of a network upfront presentation. This is the music of possibility, of the promise that this season's lineup will change everything. Major keys, bold harmonic movement, the sound of TV marketing campaigns from the 2000s. Think John Williams scoring NBC News, Mike Post's television themes, Hans Zimmer's trailer bombast.

**2. The Tension of the Reality**
Minimal piano, sustained string drones, electronic ambiance, the uncomfortable silence of a difficult decision. This is the music of isolation, of sitting alone with a scheduling board at 3 AM, of the weight of cancellation. Minor keys, unresolved harmonies, space and breath. Think Trent Reznor's corporate dread, Jóhann Jóhannsson's slow-building tension.

The music system must know when to be which. It must swell when you're winning and withdraw when you're struggling. It must be bombastic during public moments (upfronts, sweeps) and intimate during private ones (cancellation calls, late-night scheduling).

### 4.2 Instrumentation

**Primary Ensemble: "The Executive Suite Orchestra"**
- **Strings:** Violins, violas, cellos, basses — capable of both lush Hollywood orchestration and sparse, sustained drones
- **Brass:** French horns (warm, authoritative), trumpets (bright, fanfare), trombones (weight and power)
- **Woodwinds:** Minimal — occasional clarinet or flute for prestige moments, but this is not a woodwind-forward score
- **Piano:** Solo piano, clean and intimate, for quiet decision-making moments
- **Percussion:** Timpani (sweeps), glockenspiel (success), sparse snare/bass drum (tension)
- **Synthesizers:** Analog warmth (Prophet, Juno), not modern digital — this is 2000s sonic texture
- **Electronic elements:** Subtle — mostly textural drones, clock-like pulses, the hum of infrastructure

**Forbidden Instruments:**
- No guitar (wrong genre association — this isn't indie, this isn't Americana)
- No synthetic EDM elements (wrong era)
- No banjo, accordion, or folk instrumentation (wrong tonal space entirely)

### 4.3 Musical Themes

**Main Theme: "The Board"**
- **Instrumentation:** Piano intro, building to full brass and strings
- **Structure:**
  - **A section** (0:00-0:30): Solo piano, introspective, minor key (A minor), questioning melody
  - **B section** (0:30-1:00): Strings enter, harmony enriches, movement toward relative major (C major)
  - **C section** (1:00-1:30): Brass fanfare, full orchestral swell, confident and aspirational
  - **Return** (1:30-2:00): Piano returns, but now with orchestral support — the decision has been made
- **Emotional arc:** Doubt → Resolve → Confidence → Reflection
- **Usage:** Main menu, credits, career summary screen
- **Duration:** 2:00
- **Feel:** This is the sound of the game — the private struggle and the public confidence in tension.

**Prestige Motif: "The Emmy"**
- **Instrumentation:** Warm strings, French horn solo
- **Harmony:** Rich major sevenths, lush and sophisticated
- **Melody:** Ascending, noble, dignified
- **Usage:** Emmy ceremony, prestige show greenlight, critical acclaim moments
- **Duration:** 12-bar phrase, 30 seconds
- **Feel:** Validation. Art recognized.

**Populist Motif: "The Hit"**
- **Instrumentation:** Bright brass, rhythmic strings, timpani
- **Harmony:** Simple major triads, bold and unambiguous
- **Melody:** Fanfare-like, ascending intervals, triumphant
- **Usage:** Ratings victory, breakout hit show, audience response
- **Duration:** 8-bar phrase, 20 seconds
- **Feel:** Success. The people have spoken.

**Crisis Motif: "The Call"**
- **Instrumentation:** Dissonant strings, low brass drone, sparse piano
- **Harmony:** Unresolved minor seconds, tritones, no tonic resolution
- **Melody:** Descending, hesitant, questioning
- **Usage:** Cancellation calls, talent revolts, budget crises, losing streaks
- **Duration:** 16-bar phrase, 40 seconds
- **Feel:** Dread. Something is wrong, and you have to fix it.

**Transition Motif: "The Shift"**
- **Instrumentation:** Synthesizer pads, clock-like pulses, string harmonics
- **Harmony:** Suspended chords, ambiguous tonality
- **Melody:** Slow, evolving, no clear resolution
- **Usage:** Era shifts (DVR adoption, streaming cliff, etc.), season transitions, late-game uncertainty
- **Duration:** Open-ended, can loop or evolve
- **Feel:** The world is changing. Can you adapt?

### 4.4 Adaptive Music System

PREMIERE's music must respond dynamically to game state. This is not a passive score — it is an active emotional feedback system.

#### System Architecture: Vertical Layering + Horizontal Transitions

**Vertical Layering (Intensity Stems)**

Each musical cue is composed of multiple stems that can be muted/unmuted in real-time based on game pressure:

**Example: "Board Work" music (the default music during scheduling)**

- **Stem 1 (Base):** Ambient pad, gentle electronic hum, minimal piano notes — always playing
- **Stem 2 (Rhythm):** Subtle pulse, clock-tick-like hi-hat, sparse — adds when player is actively placing cards
- **Stem 3 (Harmony):** String sustains, gentle harmonic movement — adds when schedule has good lead-in flow
- **Stem 4 (Tension):** Dissonant string harmonics, low brass drone — adds when empty slots remain or sweeps pressure is high
- **Stem 5 (Triumph):** Bright brass, ascending melody — adds when player has built a strong lineup

The system evaluates game state every 4 bars (roughly every 8-12 seconds) and fades stems in/out with smooth crossfades (2-bar transition). The player never hears an abrupt change, but the emotional intensity of the music shifts based on what's happening.

**Horizontal Transitions (Contextual Cues)**

Major game state changes trigger full musical transitions:

| Game State | Musical Response | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Schedule locked (week starts)** | "Board Work" fades out, "Time Passage" cue fades in (clock rhythms, building anticipation) | 2-bar crossfade |
| **Ratings arriving** | "Time Passage" crescendos, then cuts to silence for 2 seconds, then "Ratings Reveal" cue begins (tension → release structure) | 4 seconds total |
| **Strong ratings week** | "Ratings Reveal" resolves into "Populist Motif" (triumphant brass) | Immediate transition |
| **Weak ratings week** | "Ratings Reveal" resolves into "Crisis Motif" (low brass drone, dissonance) | Immediate transition |
| **Cancellation event** | All music fades to silence, then "Crisis Motif" enters quietly, phone ring over it | 2 seconds silence, then cue |
| **Sweeps month begins** | Intensity stems all activate (full orchestra), tempo slightly increases (from 80 BPM to 90 BPM) | 4-bar transition |
| **Sweeps month ends** | Tempo returns to 80 BPM, tension stems fade out | 4-bar transition |

#### Adaptive System Rules

**Rule 1: Silence is a tool.**
Music does not play constantly. During high-tension moments (cancellation calls, urgent talent negotiations, crisis decisions), music fades out completely. The absence of music makes the player focus on the moment. Silence creates pressure that music cannot.

**Rule 2: Public moments are loud, private moments are quiet.**
- **Public (upfronts, Emmy ceremonies, ratings victory):** Full orchestra, big and brassy
- **Private (schedule work, late night, difficult decisions):** Minimal — piano, pads, space

**Rule 3: The music never tells the player how to feel about a decision.**
Music responds to outcomes (ratings, awards, profit), not to the player's choices. Greenlighting a risky prestige drama has no musical fanfare. The music only comments when the results come in. This preserves player agency — the game doesn't moralize, it reports.

**Rule 4: Era shifts have musical signatures.**
The score subtly evolves across the 12-year span:
- **2000-2003:** Full orchestral, aspirational, confident (peak network television power)
- **2004-2007:** Orchestra + subtle electronics, slight tension creeping in (reality TV disruption, DVR adoption)
- **2008-2012:** Electronics more prominent, orchestral elements thinner, unresolved harmonies (streaming cliff, DVR erosion, institutional decline)

The player may not consciously notice, but the music is telling the story of an industry in transition.

### 4.5 Music Tracklist (Composable Cues)

These are the specific cues that need to be composed:

| Cue Name | Duration | Instrumentation | Usage | Adaptive Stems |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Main Theme: The Board** | 2:00 (loopable) | Piano, strings, brass | Main menu, career summary | N/A (linear) |
| **Board Work (Calm)** | 3:00 (seamless loop) | Piano, pads, minimal strings | Default scheduling music | 5 stems as described above |
| **Board Work (Pressure)** | 3:00 (seamless loop) | Same as above but tension stems foregrounded | Sweeps scheduling, late season | Same 5 stems, different default mix |
| **Time Passage** | 1:30 (non-looping) | Clock pulses, building strings | Week simulation | N/A (linear crescendo) |
| **Ratings Reveal** | 2:00 (sections) | Tense strings, anticipatory rhythm | Overnight ratings sequence | N/A (linear tension → resolution) |
| **Populist Motif: The Hit** | 0:30 | Bright brass, triumphant | High ratings, hit show | N/A (short sting) |
| **Prestige Motif: The Emmy** | 0:30 | Warm strings, horn | Emmy wins, critical acclaim | N/A (short sting) |
| **Crisis Motif: The Call** | 1:00 (loopable) | Dissonant strings, low brass | Cancellation, talent crisis | N/A (sustain loop) |
| **Transition Motif: The Shift** | 2:00 (loopable) | Synth pads, string harmonics | Era shifts, season transitions | N/A (ambient loop) |
| **Upfront Presentation** | 2:30 (non-looping) | Full orchestra, bright and bold | Upfront event sequence | N/A (linear fanfare) |
| **Emmy Ceremony** | 1:30 (loopable section) | Hollywood awards style orchestral | Emmy ceremony | N/A (loop with button-press triggered stings for wins) |
| **Annual Review (Positive)** | 1:00 | Dignified brass, warm strings | Strong performance review | N/A (linear) |
| **Annual Review (Negative)** | 1:00 | Cold strings, low brass | Weak performance review | N/A (linear) |
| **Firing / Game Over** | 0:45 | Descending piano, strings fade to silence | Game over sequence | N/A (linear, ends in silence) |
| **Career Legacy** | 2:30 | Full orchestral, emotional arc | End credits, career retrospective | N/A (linear) |

**Total Music Needed:** Approximately 25-30 minutes of composed music across 14 cues, with 5 stem variations for adaptive cues.

## 5. Adaptive Audio System Design

### 5.1 System Overview

PREMIERE's audio system is **state-driven**, not scripted. The game continuously evaluates multiple state variables and adjusts the audio mix, music intensity, ambiance layers, and SFX behavior in real-time.

**Core Philosophy:** The audio should make the player FEEL the game state before they read it. If the budget is low, the player should hear tension in the music and increased silence in the ambiance. If ratings are soaring, the player should hear confidence in the mix. Audio is the emotional translation layer between data and feeling.

### 5.2 State Variables

The audio system tracks the following game state variables:

| Variable | Range | Audio Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Network Performance (last 4 weeks avg)** | 1st-4th place | Mix brightness, music intensity, ambiance confidence |
| **Budget Health** | -$20M to +$50M | Tension stem presence, crisis motif triggers |
| **Season Phase** | Fall / Sweeps / Midseason / Finale | Music tempo, ambiance density, event fanfare presence |
| **Current Action Context** | Scheduling / Reviewing / Negotiating / Simulating | Which music cue is active, ambiance layer mix |
| **Prestige vs Popularity Balance** | 0-100 on each axis | Orchestral texture (prestige = strings/horns, popularity = brass/bright) |
| **Time of Day (diegetic)** | 9 AM - 3 AM | Ambiance density (late night = sparse, empty, isolated) |
| **Era Year** | 2000-2012 | Music electronic content, filter textures, nostalgic cues |
| **Player Stress Level** | Calculated from empty slots, declining ratings, low budget, upcoming sweeps | Silence ratio increases, music tension stems activate, heartbeat-like bass pulse |

### 5.3 Adaptive Mixing System

The game's audio mix is dynamically adjusted based on context. There are three primary mix states:

#### Mix State 1: **Focus Mode (Scheduling)**

**When:** Player is actively interacting with The Board, placing cards, reviewing options.

**Mix Profile:**
- **Board interaction SFX:** 0dB (full volume, foreground)
- **Ambiance:** -8dB (background presence, not intrusive)
- **Music:** -6dB (supportive, not dominant)
- **Voiceover/Events:** Muted (no interruptions during focus)

**Frequency Profile:**
- **Mid-range emphasis** (500-3kHz) — clarity for card snaps, clicks, number updates
- **Low-end support** (80-200Hz) — weight and tactility for physical interactions
- **High-end sparkle** (4-8kHz) — chimes, confirmations, positive feedback

**Feel:** You are in control. The Board is the world. Everything else is background.

#### Mix State 2: **Observation Mode (Ratings, Events, Simulation)**

**When:** Player is watching results unfold, reading news, listening to phone calls.

**Mix Profile:**
- **Board interaction SFX:** Muted (Board is not interactive during this mode)
- **Ambiance:** -10dB (very background, almost subliminal)
- **Music:** -3dB (more prominent, emotional driver)
- **Voiceover/Events:** 0dB (foreground, player is receiving information)

**Frequency Profile:**
- **Full spectrum balance** — music and voice need clarity
- **Telephone EQ** when phone calls are active (bandpass 300-3400Hz on caller voice)

**Feel:** You are receiving the verdict. The world is telling you what happened.

#### Mix State 3: **Pressure Mode (Sweeps, Crisis, Late Night)**

**When:** High-stress situations — sweeps months, budget crisis, losing streak, late-night scheduling sessions.

**Mix Profile:**
- **Board interaction SFX:** 0dB (same as Focus Mode)
- **Ambiance:** -12dB (much quieter, almost absent — silence becomes oppressive)
- **Music:** Variable — either -3dB (tension stems) or completely absent (silence is the music)
- **Voiceover/Events:** -2dB (slightly quieter, more intimate/threatening)

**Frequency Profile:**
- **Low-frequency emphasis** (60-150Hz) — sub-bass dread, pressure
- **High-frequency reduction** (above 6kHz) — less sparkle, more claustrophobic
- **Mid-range compression** — tighter dynamic range, everything feels closer

**Feel:** The walls are closing in. Every decision matters. The pressure is physical.

### 5.4 Spatial Audio & Panning

PREMIERE is a 2D interface game, but spatial audio creates depth and environmental realism.

**Spatial Map:**

```
                    [DISTANT SOUNDSTAGE]
                         (center, -20dB, reverb)
                                |
    [HALLWAY]                                      [HALLWAY]
    (left, -15dB)                                  (right, -15dB)
         |                                              |
         |                                              |
    [OFFICE DOOR]  -------  [PLAYER POV]  -------  [PHONE]
    (left 45°)            (center, 0dB)            (right 45°)
         |                                              |
         |                                              |
    [WINDOW/CITY]                                  [DESK]
    (left 90°, -25dB)                              (right, -5dB)
```

**Spatial Design Rules:**

- **The Board:** Center stereo image, no panning — this is directly in front of the player
- **Phone calls:** Right channel bias (phone is on right side of desk), processed with phone EQ
- **Office ambiance:** Stereo wide, immersive, surrounds the player
- **Distant events (soundstage audience, other offices):** Far left/right, heavily attenuated, reverberant
- **Desk interactions (paper, coffee):** Right channel bias (right-handed desk setup)
- **Hallway sounds:** Left or right depending on which hallway, panned 45-90°
- **City ambiance (through window):** Left channel, very quiet, only present in rare quiet moments

**Reverb Profile:**
- **Corner office:** Medium reverb (1.2s RT60), professional office space
- **Late night:** Longer reverb (1.8s RT60), emptier acoustic, more reflective
- **Phone calls:** No reverb on caller voice (they're not in the room), slight reverb on player responses if implemented
- **Upfront ballroom:** Large hall reverb (2.5s RT60), grandeur and space

### 5.5 Dynamic Silence System

Silence is not the absence of audio — silence is a compositional tool. PREMIERE uses **Dynamic Silence** to create tension and focus.

**Silence Triggers:**

| Game Moment | Silence Duration | What Remains | What Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cancellation decision confirmed** | 1.5 seconds | Fluorescent hum only (60Hz) | Crisis motif fades in quietly |
| **Ratings reveal (just before numbers appear)** | 2 seconds | Complete silence | Numbers type in with sound |
| **Firing event begins** | 3 seconds | Complete silence | The Suit's voice, no music |
| **Player staring at empty Board slot in sweeps** | Gradual — music fades over 10 seconds | Ambiance + empty slot warning pulse | Returns when card is placed |
| **End of career (final screen)** | 5 seconds | Complete silence | Legacy score music begins softly |

**Implementation:**
- Silence is achieved by fading all audio stems to -60dB over 0.5-1 second, not by hard-cutting (which causes jarring clicks)
- Room tone (fluorescent hum, HVAC) can remain at -40dB during "silence" — it's subliminal but prevents true dead air
- Silence is broken *intentionally* — the first sound after silence should be significant (voice, crisis motif, confirmation tone)

---

## 6. Mix Hierarchy

The mix hierarchy defines what the player hears when multiple sounds compete for attention. This is critical for readability — the player must always hear the most important information.

### 6.1 Frequency Spectrum Allocation

| Frequency Range | Primary Content | Secondary Content | Forbidden Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sub-bass (20-60Hz)** | Pressure/dread tones, late-night ambiance, crisis drone | Timpani, bass drum (sweeps) | Nothing else (keep clean) |
| **Low (60-200Hz)** | Card placement weight, phone line noise, low brass, bass pulse | String bass, synthesizer pads | Avoid clutter here |
| **Low-mid (200-500Hz)** | Warmth of music (cellos, horns), body of voice, phone EQ lower band | Ambiance room tone | Don't stack too much here or mix gets muddy |
| **Mid (500-2kHz)** | PRIMARY INTERACTION SOUNDS — card snaps, clicks, number updates, voice intelligibility | Music melody (piano, strings), phone EQ upper band | This is the "readability band" — protect it |
| **High-mid (2-5kHz)** | Chimes, confirmations, positive feedback, voice clarity | String harmonics, brass brilliance | Critical for intelligibility |
| **High (5-10kHz)** | Air, sparkle, paper rustle, high-frequency details | Cymbals (rare), glockenspiel | Don't over-brighten |
| **Ultra-high (10-20kHz)** | Subtle air texture, realism | Almost nothing | Avoid harshness |

**Mastering Target:**
- **Dynamic Range:** Wide (20-30dB between quietest and loudest moments) — this is NOT a pop song, compression should be minimal
- **Peak Loudness:** -6dB peak (leave headroom for dynamic events)
- **Integrated LUFS:** Around -18 LUFS (comfortable listening level for long sessions)

### 6.2 Priority Hierarchy (What Wins in Conflicts)

When multiple sounds trigger simultaneously, the following priority system determines what the player hears:

**Tier 1 (Always Audible):**
1. **Player interaction feedback** (card placement, clicks, confirmations) — this is the core loop, never mask it
2. **Critical warnings** (empty slot alarm, budget crisis, firing warning) — player needs to know something is wrong
3. **Phone calls / voice events** (showrunner on the line, The Suit speaking) — narrative is sacred

**Tier 2 (Important but Can Be Delayed):**
4. **Ratings reveal numbers** — can stagger if 21 shows all reveal at once
5. **Music transitions** — if a Tier 1 sound is playing, music waits to transition
6. **Notification sounds** (memos, headlines) — can be queued

**Tier 3 (Ambient, Always Duckable):**
7. **Music underscores** — ducks -6dB when Tier 1 or 2 sounds play
8. **Ambiance layers** — ducks -8dB when Tier 1 sounds play, -4dB for Tier 2
9. **Distant environmental sounds** — fully muted when focus is required

**Ducking Implementation:**
- **Attack:** 50ms (fast enough to be immediate, slow enough to avoid clicks)
- **Release:** 300ms (smooth return to normal levels)
- **Duck amount:** -4 to -8dB depending on priority tier

**Example Scenario:**
Player is scheduling during sweeps (music is playing, ambiance is present). They place a card that creates strong lead-in flow (Tier 1 sound: card snap + lead-in synergy chime). Music ducks -6dB for 800ms. Ambiance ducks -8dB for 800ms. The card sound and chime are crystal clear. Music and ambiance return to full volume after the interaction completes.

---

## 7. Implementation Plan & Technical Requirements

### 7.1 Audio Middleware Recommendation

**Primary Tool: FMOD Studio**

**Why FMOD:**
- Robust adaptive music system with vertical layering and horizontal sequencing
- Real-time parameter control (game state variables can drive mix, music intensity, etc.)
- Seamless looping and crossfading for music stems
- Mature Unity/Unreal integration (assuming PREMIERE is built in one of these engines)
- Event-based architecture aligns with PREMIERE's discrete interaction model (card placement, ratings reveal, etc.)
- 3D spatialization support for future Steam Deck haptic integration

**Alternative: Wwise**
- Equally capable, slightly steeper learning curve
- Better for extremely complex branching music (PREMIERE's needs are advanced but not extreme)
- If the dev team already has Wwise expertise, it's a valid choice

**Not Recommended: Pure Engine Audio (Unity/Unreal native)**
- Insufficient adaptive music tools for PREMIERE's needs
- Would require extensive custom scripting to achieve the same results FMOD/Wwise provide out-of-box
- Only consider if budget is extremely constrained

### 7.2 File Format & Delivery Specs

**Music & Ambiance (Looping Assets):**
- **Format:** 48kHz / 24-bit WAV (master files), 44.1kHz / 16-bit OGG Vorbis (in-game delivery)
- **Compression:** OGG Q7 (high quality, ~160-192kbps VBR) — keeps file size reasonable without audible loss
- **Looping:** All loops must be sample-accurate seamless (verified with zero-crossing loop points, tested for phase coherence)
- **Stems:** Delivered as separate files, synced to same tempo/start point, named consistently (e.g., BoardWork_Stem1_Base.wav, BoardWork_Stem2_Rhythm.wav, etc.)

**SFX (One-Shot & Short Assets):**
- **Format:** 48kHz / 24-bit WAV (master), 44.1kHz / 16-bit WAV or OGG (in-game, depending on length)
  - **Guideline:** <2 seconds = WAV (minimal size penalty, avoids OGG encoding latency), >2 seconds = OGG
- **Variants:** All SFX with variants (e.g., 8 card snap variants) delivered as separate files, named with _v1, _v2, etc. suffixes
- **Normalization:** Peak normalize to -3dB (leave headroom for in-engine mixing)

**Voice (Phone Calls, Narrative):**
- **Format:** 48kHz / 24-bit WAV (master), 44.1kHz / 16-bit OGG Mono (in-game)
- **Processing Chain (Pre-Delivery):**
  1. Record clean (no phone EQ yet) in a treated space
  2. EQ: High-pass at 80Hz (remove rumble), de-ess at 6-8kHz (control sibilance)
  3. Compression: 3:1 ratio, -18dB threshold, medium attack/release (even out dynamics)
  4. Phone EQ applied in-engine via FMOD (allows real-time toggling if needed for design iteration)
- **Delivery:** Clean processed voice files, FMOD applies phone bandpass filter (300-3400Hz) + light distortion + phone line noise layer

**Ambiance (Continuous Environmental Loops):**
- **Format:** 48kHz / 24-bit WAV (master), 44.1kHz / 16-bit OGG Vorbis Q8 (in-game)
- **Length:** Minimum 60 seconds per loop (avoids perceptible repetition), 120 seconds preferred for primary ambiances
- **Layering:** Delivered as separate stems (e.g., Office_Fluorescent.ogg, Office_HVAC.ogg, Office_Murmur.ogg) so mix can be adjusted dynamically

### 7.3 Asset List & Scope

**Estimated Asset Count:**

| Category | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Music Cues** | 14 tracks, ~28 minutes total | Includes main theme, adaptive cues, stings |
| **Music Stems (for adaptive cues)** | 40+ stem files | 5 stems x 2 adaptive cues (Board Work Calm/Pressure) + additional layers |
| **SFX (Unique Sounds)** | ~120 unique SFX | Includes all interaction, notification, event sounds |
| **SFX Variants** | ~350 total files | Many SFX have 4-16 variants for variety |
| **Ambiance Loops** | 12 loops | Office (day/night), upfront ballroom, soundstage bleed, etc. |
| **Voice Lines** | 50-100 lines | Talent phone calls, The Suit's reviews, Emmy announcements (if not using dynamic TTS) |
| **Total Audio Files** | ~500-550 files | Delivered as organized asset pack |
| **Total Disk Space (Compressed)** | ~400-600 MB | OGG compression keeps this reasonable |

### 7.4 Production Pipeline

**Phase 1: Pre-Production (Weeks 1-2)**
- Sonic palette exploration: record test ambiances, create temp music sketches, prototype key SFX (card snap, phone ring)
- Lock Board interaction sound design first (this is the core loop — must be perfect before moving forward)
- Integrate temp assets into prototype build, playtest for feel
- **Deliverable:** Approved temp audio pack for vertical slice

**Phase 2: Music Composition (Weeks 3-8)**
- Compose main theme and 3 primary motifs (Prestige, Populist, Crisis)

- Performance optimization (file compression, streaming vs. preload decisions, memory footprint)
- Final mix adjustments based on late-game playtesting feedback
- **Deliverable:** Shippable audio

**Total Timeline: 18 weeks** (with 2-week buffer for revisions)

### 7.5 Team & Budget Estimate

**Recommended Team:**
- **1 Audio Director / Lead Sound Designer** (full-time, 18 weeks) — oversees all audio, designs core SFX, manages team
- **1 Composer** (contract, 8 weeks) — composes all music, delivers stems, collaborates on adaptive system design

- **Minimum viable audio budget: ~$115,000**

### 7.6 Technical Requirements & Performance

**Memory Budget:**
- **Preloaded assets (always in memory):** ~80 MB
  - Core SFX (Board interactions, UI, notifications): 30 MB
  - Primary ambiance loops (office, late-night): 20 MB
  - Music stem preload buffers: 30 MB
- **Streamed assets (loaded contextually):** ~320 MB
  - Music cues: 150 MB
  - Voice lines: 80 MB
  - Event-specific SFX and ambiances: 90 MB
- **Total audio memory footprint:** ~400 MB (reasonable for modern PC/Steam Deck)

**Streaming Strategy:**
- **Music:** Stream all music cues (28 min total, too large to preload all at once). FMOD handles seamless streaming.
- **Ambiance:** Preload primary loops (office ambiance), stream contextual loops (upfront ballroom, soundstage)
- **SFX:** Preload all interaction SFX (frequently used), stream event-specific SFX (Emmy ceremony, etc.)
- **Voice:** Stream all VO (only loads when events trigger)

**Performance Targets:**
- **CPU:** Audio processing should use <5% CPU on recommended spec PC (FMOD is well-optimized, this is achievable)
- **Latency:** <20ms from player interaction to sound feedback (critical for Board interaction feel)
- **Simultaneous Voices:** Support 32+ simultaneous audio sources (ambiance layers + music stems + SFX + VO)

**Platform-Specific Considerations:**
- **Steam Deck:** Test with headphones AND built-in speakers (speakers have limited bass response, mix must be intelligible on both)
- **Spatial audio:** Optional Windows Sonic / Dolby Atmos support for users who have it (FMOD supports this), but design mix for stereo first

## 8. Silence Map

Silence is not the absence of sound — it is the presence of negative space. In PREMIERE, silence is compositional. It creates tension, focuses attention, and amplifies the weight of decisions.

### 8.1 Philosophy of Silence

In most games, audio designers fear silence. They fill every gap with ambiance, every moment with music, every pause with sound. This is a mistake.

Silence creates pressure. Silence makes the player aware of their own breathing. Silence turns a decision from routine to significant. Silence says: "This matters."

PREMIERE uses silence strategically, at moments where the player must sit with the weight of what they're about to do, or what they've just done.

### 8.2 Key Silence Moments

**1. Cancellation Decision (Pre-Confirmation)**

**When:** Player has selected "Cancel Show" from the menu but hasn't confirmed yet. The confirmation dialog appears.

**Silence Duration:** 2 seconds

**What Remains:**
- Fluorescent hum (60 Hz, -40dB) — barely perceptible, subliminal
- Distant HVAC breathe (very quiet, like the building is breathing)

**What's Absent:**
- All music (fades out over 1 second before silence begins)
- Office ambiance (voices, footsteps, phones — all fade out)
- UI sounds (temporarily muted)

**Why:** This is the moment before the decision is final. The silence makes the player sit with it. It's uncomfortable. It should be.

**What Breaks the Silence:** Either the player clicks "Confirm" (heavy rubber stamp sound, then Crisis Motif begins), or "Cancel" (soft click, ambiance returns).

---

**2. Ratings Reveal (Pre-Numbers)**

**When:** The week simulation has finished, the "Overnight Ratings" printout has landed on the desk, and the player is about to see the numbers.

**Silence Duration:** 1.5 seconds (after printout sound completes)

**What Remains:** Nothing. True silence. No ambiance, no music, no hum.

**What's Absent:** Everything.

**Why:** The player has placed their bet. The results are about to arrive. This moment of silence is anticipation made physical. It's the held breath before a dice roll.

**What Breaks the Silence:** The first show's number types in, triggering the "number reveal" sound and beginning the staggered reveal sequence.

---

**3. Firing Event (Game Over)**

**When:** The Suit tells the player they're being let go.

**Silence Duration:** 3 seconds (after "We're making a change" line completes)

**What Remains:**
- The Suit's breath (quiet, processed to sound slightly distant)
- Very faint office ambiance (muffled, like hearing through water)

**What's Absent:**
- All music
- All UI sounds
- Normal ambiance (it's all filtered and attenuated, creating a dissociative, "underwater" feeling)

**Why:** The player's career just ended. The silence is the void. It's the moment of realization, of processing, of loss. The game doesn't rush past this moment. It lets the player sit in it.

**What Breaks the Silence:** A low drone fades in (60Hz, very quiet), then after 5 seconds total, the "Career Legacy" screen fades in and the Legacy music begins softly.

---

**4. Empty Slot at Sweeps (Gradual Silence)**

**When:** The player is scheduling during a sweeps month, and a primetime slot remains empty as they're working.

**Silence Duration:** Not a hard cut — a gradual fade. Music fades out over 10 seconds, ambiance thins over 15 seconds.

**What Remains:**
- Empty slot warning pulse (60Hz low-frequency drone, pulsing every 3 seconds)
- Fluorescent hum (becomes more noticeable as other sounds fade)
- Player's own interaction sounds (card drags, clicks)

**What's Absent:**
- Music (fades to nothing)
- Office ambiance (distant voices, phones — all fade out, leaving an oppressive emptiness)

**Why:** The empty slot is a problem. The silence is the game saying: "You need to fix this. The absence of a show is the absence of sound." The longer the player leaves it empty, the more oppressive the silence becomes.

**What Breaks the Silence:** Placing a card in the empty slot. The moment the card snaps into place, music and ambiance return over 4 seconds (relief, the problem is solved).

---

**5. Career End (Final Screen, Before Legacy Music)**

**When:** The player has reached 2012, the final season has ended, the career is complete. The screen fades to black before the Legacy Score screen appears.

**Silence Duration:** 5 seconds of complete black screen, complete silence.

**What Remains:** Nothing.

**What's Absent:** Everything.

**Why:** This is the end of an era. Not just the player's career, but the era of network television dominance. The silence is reflection. It's the space for the player to think about what they built, what they cancelled, who they hurt, who they elevated. The game doesn't rush to judgment. It gives the player space.

**What Breaks the Silence:** The Legacy Score screen fades in (visual first, still silent for 2 more seconds), then the "Career Legacy" orchestral cue begins softly, building gradually.

---

**6. Late Night Scheduling (Diegetic Silence)**

**When:** Player is scheduling after midnight (diegetic game time, triggered if player spends 30+ minutes in a single session during a pressure week).

**Silence Duration:** Not a hard silence, but the ambiance becomes extremely sparse.

**What Remains:**
- Fluorescent hum (more noticeable, almost oppressive)
- HVAC breathe (every 6 seconds, sounds louder in the emptiness)
- Occasional building creak (random, 30-60 second intervals)
- Player's own interaction sounds

**What's Absent:**
- Office ambiance (voices, phones, footsteps — the building is empty)
- Music (fades out after 1 minute of late-night mode, doesn't return until ratings or events)

**Why:** It's 2 AM. You're alone. The isolation is the point. The silence makes the player feel the cost of the job — the hours, the pressure, the loneliness of the corner office.

**What Breaks the Silence:** Completing the schedule (music returns when week locks), or the sun rising (diegetic time shift back to day — office ambiance gradually returns).

---

### 8.3 Silence Implementation Notes

**Technical:**
- Silence is achieved by fading audio stems to -60dB (inaudible) rather than hard-cutting (avoids clicks)
- Fade curves should be logarithmic (perceptually smooth)
- When "What Remains" specifies ambiance, those elements are at -35 to -40dB (subliminal, barely conscious)

**Design Rule:**
Silence is NEVER used casually. Every silence moment must be:
1. **Intentional** — serves a specific emotional purpose
2. **Bounded** — has a clear trigger and a clear exit
3. **Uncomfortable** — silence should create tension, not relaxation

If the player feels comfortable in silence, it's not working. Silence in PREMIERE should make the player want to DO something to break it — place a card, confirm a decision, move forward. Silence is pressure.

## 9. Final Note: Audio IS Game Feel

Every number in this document — every frequency, every duration, every fade curve — exists to serve one goal: make the player's body respond before their mind catches up.

When the player places a show card in Thursday at 9 PM, they should FEEL the weight of that decision through the magnetic snap, through the lead-in synergy chime, through the music swell or silence that follows. When overnight ratings arrive and their flagship just got crushed, they should FEEL the loss in the descending tone, in the low brass drone, in the oppressive silence before the phone rings.

Audio is not decoration. Audio is not polish. Audio is the invisible architecture of game feel.

PREMIERE's audio design is built on three principles:

**1. Tactility**
Every interaction has a distinct, satisfying audio signature. The Board must feel like a physical object you're touching.

**2. Emotional Honesty**
The audio responds to outcomes, not to decisions. It doesn't moralize. It reports. When you cancel a show, the sound doesn't judge you — but it makes you sit with what you've done.

**3. Silence as Composition**
Silence is not a failure of sound design. Silence is a tool. The most powerful moments in PREMIERE are the ones where the audio pulls back and lets the player hear the space between.

If the audio in PREMIERE does its job, the player will remember moments not by what they saw on The Board, but by what they heard. The phone ring before bad news. The silence after a cancellation. The brass swell when they won sweeps. The low hum of fluorescent lights at 2 AM when the schedule still isn't done.

Close your eyes. What do you hear?

That's PREMIERE.
